Source: https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-regalia-gold-credit-card-review

Earlier in 2023 HDFC launched Regalia Gold which is an upgraded version of their most popularHDFC Regaliacredit card. With this, the HDFC Bank has positioned it just below the HDFC luxury twinsHDFC Infinia Credit Cardand HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card. I have recently taken a plunge into it.

Here’s everything you wish to know about the card.

HDFC has done away with reward points on both welcome and annual benefits on Regalia Gold which I found surprising since its a premium reward points based travel card.

*Except for Fuel, Rental Payments, Packers and Movers, Government Transactions, Wallet loads, and Easy EMI transactions.

HDFC Bank has a dedicated portal namedSmartBuywith which we get some extra rewards and cashback.

Although the maximum value on paper lies in the redemptions via Gold Catalogue in which you can buy iPhones, Bose products and Samsung phones then you will be missing the instant card discount on the same. The best redemptions on Regalia Gold would be airmiles or hotel redemptions since it comes with a gold partner redemption list or else simply you can go for travel redemptions from theSmartBuyportal.

We have compiled all theAirmiles transfer partnersandhotel loyalty partnersfor Regalia Gold.

All these benefits add up to ₹16,000 on a spend of ₹7.5L a year which is approximately 2.1% of additional benefits other than the base rewards.

Access Via – Credit CardComplimentary Domestic Limit– 12 Visits/ Calendar year within India (Shared between Primary & maximum 3 Add-on cardholders but both cards cannot be used for the same lounge, same day).Network – Visa Signature/ MasterCard World

You can avail of 1 voucher per booking if you book your flight tickets through the Regalia Gold UnifiedSmartbuyportal. You have to generate your voucher code and use it in the Uber application for the airport pick-and-drop service. This voucher can be generated a maximum of twice per quarter. Quite a unique and value-oriented feature I must say.

No fuel surcharge waiver is applicable on this card.

Officially the bank has the following criteria but can vary as per your relationship with the bank.

For Salaried Indian national

For Self Employed Indian national

Unofficially, If you are an existing HDFC Credit Cardholder then you can ask for an upgrade if there is a 3L limit on your existing card.

HDFC Regalia Gold Credit Card is definitely a highly rewarding and lifestyle credit card and is also the gateway to the HDFC twins. With an upgraded list of transfer partners, travel vouchers and complimentary airport transfers this card surely packs a lot of punch.

Since many LTFRegaliaholders have already received an upgrade invite to FYF Regalia Gold I would recommend them to take the plunge and enjoy the shining new card and the host of benefits that it has to offer over its predecessor.
