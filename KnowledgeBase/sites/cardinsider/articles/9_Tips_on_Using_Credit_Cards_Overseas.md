15 May, 2025  / By  [ Rajat Gaur  ](https://cardinsider.com/author/rajat/ "View all posts by Rajat Gaur") /  [Leave a Comment](https://cardinsider.com/blog/tips-on-using-credit-cards-overseas/#respond)
Traveling internationally can be an exciting adventure, but it also comes with its own challenges, especially concerning finances. It’s important to prepare your credit cards for international use to avoid interruption during your trip. This article shares nine helpful tips for using credit cards while traveling abroad.
Imagine arriving in a vibrant foreign city, ready to explore its culture and cuisine. But suddenly, your credit card gets declined, leaving you feeling stranded. This situation can happen to anyone traveling overseas, which is why being vigilant about using credit cards abroad is essential.
![9 Tips on Using Credit-Cards Overseas](https://cd9941cc.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9-Tips-on-Using-Credit-Cards-Overseas.webp)
From checking if your cards are globally accepted to enabling international transactions, we’ll guide you through the necessary steps. We’ll highlight the importance of avoiding dynamic currency conversion and considering travel insurance for peace of mind. With these tips, you can enjoy your travels without worrying about financial hurdles, allowing you to focus on creating unforgettable memories.
## The Card Should be Globally Accepted
While most cards are usually accepted globally, it is necessary to check whether the cards that you are carrying for your international trip are accepted or not. Visa and [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.co.in/en-in.html) are commonly accepted throughout the world, but if you have a RuPay credit card, make sure to check if it is available in the said country. Also, make sure that the cards are activated for international transactions.
## Carry Multiple Cards
Carrying [multiple credit cards](https://cardinsider.com/blog/handle-multiple-credit-cards-pro/) while traveling is a smart strategy for several reasons. First, it provides a backup in case one card gets lost, stolen, or declined. Having an additional card means you won’t be stranded without payment options. Second, different cards offer various benefits, such as lower foreign transaction fees or travel rewards, which can help you save money on purchases and earn points. Lastly, some merchants might accept only certain types of cards, so having a mix (like Visa and Mastercard) ensures you can complete transactions easily.
## Enable International Transactions
When traveling abroad, it’s important to enable international transactions on your credit cards. Before you leave, contact your bank or credit card company to ensure your card is activated for overseas use. This step prevents any issues while trying to make purchases or withdraw cash in a foreign country. Some banks might require you to notify them of your travel plans, so be sure to mention the countries you’ll visit and the dates. Check if there are any foreign transaction fees associated with your card, as this can affect your spending. By taking these simple steps, you can enjoy your trip without worrying about payment problems and can use your card confidently wherever you go.
## Try Prepaid Forex Cards
When traveling abroad, using prepaid forex cards can be a great way to manage your money. These cards are loaded with a specific amount of foreign currency, which means you can use them just like a regular credit card to make purchases or withdraw cash. Since the money is preloaded, you won’t have to worry about overspending or incurring unexpected fees. Prepaid forex cards are usually better for avoiding high foreign transaction fees that can come with regular credit cards. They also offer a fixed exchange rate when you load them, so you know exactly how much you’re spending in your home currency. Plus, if your card gets lost or stolen, you can often get it replaced relatively easily, and you won’t lose all your money since it’s not linked to your bank account.
## Check the Forex Mark-up Charges
Whenever you make a transaction with your credit card in a foreign currency, your card issuer charges a small fraction of the transacted amount as a markup fee for processing the transaction. Usually, the mark-up fee is around 3.5% of the transacted amount (plus GST).
Some credit cards- most super-premium credit cards and premium travel credit cards charge a lower markup fee on foreign currency transactions. For example, the mark-up fee applicable on transactions made in a foreign currency with [HDFC Infinia](https://cardinsider.com/hdfc-bank/hdfc-bank-infinia-credit-card/) Credit Card or HDFC [Diners Club Black Credit Card](https://cardinsider.com/hdfc-bank/hdfc-bank-diners-club-black-credit-card/), two of the most premium credit cards currently available in the market, is just 2% of the transaction amount. If you own one or more such credit cards with a lower foreign currency mark-up fee, you should always prefer them for international transactions.
## Avoid Dynamic Currency Conversion
When you pay with your credit card in a foreign currency, the normal process is- the amount is paid by your card issuer to the merchant in the foreign currency (i.e., the currency of the merchant), which is later converted by the issuer to your home currency (INR in case of India) and reflected on your card’s statement.
Some merchants allow dynamic currency conversion at POS, i.e., the amount is converted into the cardholder’s home currency at the point of sale, and then the card issuer pays the merchant in your home currency. Although it might be convenient to see the transaction in your home currency, the exchange rate levied by the merchants is usually much higher than what your card issuer would have charged. Therefore, even if a merchant offers the [dynamic currency conversion](https://cardinsider.com/blog/everything-need-know-about-dynamic-currency-conversion-fee/) facility, it is better not to avail of the same so that you may get the best possible currency conversion rate.
## Consider Travel Insurance
Before going on an international trip, a credit card holder should seriously think about getting travel insurance. This is important because travel insurance can protect you from unexpected problems, like trip cancellations, medical emergencies, or lost luggage. If something goes wrong, such as needing a doctor while abroad or having to change your travel plans, travel insurance can help cover those costs, saving you from a lot of stress and financial burdens. Plus, some credit cards offer additional travel benefits, but having insurance gives you that extra security, knowing you’re covered no matter what happens during your trip.
## Carry a Backup Payment Method
When traveling abroad, it’s a good idea to carry a backup payment method, like some extra cash. Having cash can help you in places that don’t accept cards, like small shops or markets. Being prepared with multiple ways to pay can make your trip much easier and less stressful, allowing you to enjoy your vacation without worrying about how you’ll buy what you need.
## Inform Your Bank or Credit Card Company
Traveling can trigger fraud alerts on your card, leading to unexpected declines. To avoid this, inform your bank or credit card company about your travel plans. This way, they know to expect foreign transactions and are less likely to block your card. You can usually do this through their mobile app or by calling customer service.
## Conclusion
Being well-prepared with your credit cards can greatly improve your international travel experience. To avoid problems with your cards when traveling abroad, follow these nine tips. First, make sure your cards can be used internationally and are accepted globally. This will help you avoid being stuck without payment options.
Carrying multiple cards, utilizing prepaid forex cards, and being aware of charges like forex markup can help you manage your finances. Lastly, avoiding dynamic currency conversion can lead to better spending outcomes. These precautions allow every traveler to focus on creating memorable experiences without financial stress, making your journey enjoyable and worry-free.
