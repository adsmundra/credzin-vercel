# IndusInd EazyDiner Signature Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/indusind-eazydiner-credit-card-review

IndusInd Bankrecently launched a co-branded credit card in collaboration with EazyDiner. It’s a surprising new addition since EazyDiner already has a slew of banking partners for various offers on their application and hence exclusivity cannot be maintained. The card has been creating a lot of hype. This keen interest is due to the devaluation of the evergreen favourites of IndusInd Bank like Iconia, Legend, and Pinnacle.

EazyDiner is a dine-out application primarily related to India and now expanding its footprint in Dubai as well. With this, you canbook tables at your nearby restaurants and even buy prepaid QSR dealsfor that on-the-go snacking.

Let’s check out all that this card brings on to the table and whether it makes sense to switch to it or not!

I know you are thinking that the joining fee has been over-compensated with the welcome benefits worth double the fee paid. But keep in mind thatPostcard Hotels is a luxury hotel chainand their most basic room starts from 16000 onwards per day with the priciest one costing nearly 2L per day! So to use that voucher you have to pay a good difference using your Indusind EazyDiner card. This more or less looks like a promotional voucher from Postcard Hotel. But if luxury is your way to go then this voucher will give you a wonderful new experience of a postcard-perfect hotel. Postcard Hotel voucher is transferable but payment at the hotel needs to be done using IndusInd EazyDiner card only.

You also get anEazyDiner Prime Membershipalong with this card which costs more than the annual fee paid itself. Plus you also get 2000 EazyPoints every year on renewal.

EazyPoints are earned differently than the Reward Points on the EazyDiner application. Following are the ways in which you can earn EazyPoints.

Out of all the above ways, you will get 3X EazyPoints on the Book a Table Feature only, and the rest of earning rate will be as usual. If you are a non-prime member you are entitled to 25 EazyPoints per diner (50 EP if you are a Prime) on booking a table so with this card you will receive 75 EazyPoints per diner.

You can earn rewards in two different forms that areReward Points and EazyPointsbut thecurrency is a single entity called EazyPoints. Now the interesting part is that theredemption process for both of them is different. As both points will be visible separately in your application once you have the card linked to your application. I would say that this is a poor execution of the product since it makes it complex to understand for a novice card user.

For redemption, you have the following options.

EazyPointswhen redeemed for a meal voucher gives you avalue of 20p eachand have a minimum spending condition. A200 voucher comes with a 1000 minimum billingcondition. Soredemptions for meal vouchers are pointlesssince you won’t be able to 20%-40% club card discounts with them and points would simply go to waste.

You can also redeem EazyPoints for a night’s stay in select juSTa Resorts in Dharamshala and Shimla. A night at juSTa Birding Dharamshala starts from 11K a night whereas juSTa Cliffend Resort & Spa Mashobra Shimla costs around 25K a night with the same redemption requirements.

Further if luxury is your cup of tea then Postcard Hotel (Goa/ Sri Lanka/ Bhutan) redemption option is also there for 30K EazyDiner points. But there is a condition of paying the full amount for the first night and then the second night becomes complimentary.

For getting themaximumout of EazyDiner points Irecommend you accumulate them and use them for hotel redemptions. But yes these points will only be worthy of a meaningful redemption if you are a regular EazyDiner user.

TechnoFino Tip:You can easily get ₹6/EazyPoint if you redeem them for the Postcard Hotel voucher and book their topmost Dewa Suite in Thimpu, Bhutan, or ₹2.5/EazyPoint if used for a night’s stay at juSTa Cliffend Resort & Spa Mashobra Shimla, India.

This card offers you an annualEazyDiner Prime Membershipon payment of your renewal fees every year which currently they are offering at a discounted price of ₹2495/year.

Now,PayEazyis a payment channel provider that helps you pay the restaurant bill. This helps you make a transaction with any debit or credit card and other popular payment gateways and enjoy offers and discounts from their payment partners. You have to keep in mind that not all restaurants available on EazyDiner give Prime benefits and also not all the Prime restaurants are PayEazy enabled. So for a maximum savings combination, a restaurant should be aPayEazy-enabled Prime restaurant.

So a bill of ₹4,000 in a restaurant gets an EazyDiner discount of let’s say, 25% and becomes 3,000 and then becomes 2250 instantly on paying via EazyPay with this card!

This is anotherunique featureof this card is that at over 200 amazing bars and restaurants, you get toenjoy a complimentary pour of Singleton Single malt Whisky or Black Dog or a glass of Fratelli Wine or a pour of Hapusa Gin per dinerin addition to the above savings! Yes, it’s unreal!

Here’s how you can avail of maximum discount when you dine in with your IndusInd EazyDiner Credit Card

New to EazyDiner?Download theapplicationand use the referral code:BHAVY9104 to get a ₹500 worth voucher.

Now, this is quite a tempting offer since this card is offering absolutelyno conditions attached to free movie tickets instead of the usual BOGO offer. All you have to pay is the difference in the ticket price and internet handling fees of BMS.This offer is similar to what I have been using for years on my Yes First Debit Card.

So if you are living in a tier 2 city where tickets are usually around ₹200 per person then two of you are covered for a free movie every month!

All overseas transactions are levied with a 3.5% +GST as transaction fee.

Enjoy a 1% fuel surcharge waiver across all fuel stations in India. This waiver is applicable for all fuel transactions between ₹400 to ₹4000 only. Since no capping has been mentioned by the bank on this card I think it’s anunlimited fuel surcharge waiver.

Since most of the listings on EazyDiner are limited to bigger cities, I wouldhighly recommendthe IndusInd Eazydiner card to you if you are living in tier-1/2 cities and regularly eat out. Even if you have better rewarding PayEazy partnered cards with you, this card makes a lot of sense since you can avail of discounts unlimited times.

Thereward rateson this card arenot that exciting. But for me, this card is aboutnew experiences like Postcard hotel stays and complimentary alcoholic beverages.

I saw so much noise regarding the high fee for this card. But I feelthe fee being asked for is a fraction of the cost of the benefits involvedsince even on usingBookMyShow benefits on this card you will be able to ₹4800 every year. With annual Prime membership, lounge access, and a good reward rate the fee is very much justified.Are you planning to get hold of the IndusInd EazyDiner Credit Card?
