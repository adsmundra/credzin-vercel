HSBC has launched the HSBC TravelOne Credit Card in India, a premium travel-centric credit card tailored for frequent travellers seeking convenience and flexibility. This card is a global card and hence is already marketed in many other countries in which the HSBC Bank operates.

This newly introduced credit card enables users to instantly convert their accumulated reward points into a wide range of airline and hotel loyalty programs, enhancing their travel experience with seamless redemptions. Designed to cater to the needs of avid travellers, the HSBC TravelOne Credit Card offers a host of exclusive benefits, making it an ideal choice for those who frequently explore new destinations.

Here’s a closer look at everything you need to know about the HSBC TravelOne Credit Card and how it can elevate your travel rewards and experiences.

The 3,000 reward points offered as a welcome benefit do not fully offset the joining fee unless redeemed for ALL Accor.

That said, HSBC is currently running an “introductory offer” where cardholders who download the HSBC mobile app and spend ₹10,000 within the first 30 days can receive:

This is not a standard offering with this card but is being given to make the card more popular initially. Some cashback and a PostCard Hotel voucher are really in line with what a travel-focused card should offer.

The following transactions are ineligible for rewards: utilities, insurance, jewellery, education, government payments, real estate, financial services, money transfers, e-wallets, and fuel purchases. The exclusion list is even lengthier than that of the Axis Bank but here there is a striking difference as compared toAxis Atlasthat you will earn 2X points even on OTA’s MMT, Yatra, Cleartrip and likes. It would have been better had there been a 2X multiplier on Hotels too.

This jacks up the reward rate by almost 0.8% which is very mediocre just like the regular reward rate (2% to 4%) on this card.

HSBC Bank provides a 1:1 transfer ratio for most loyalty programs and has roped in a lot of new loyalty programs from Indians’ point of view.

Currently, there is no capping on the reward points transfer which is great.

HSBC Bank is not asking for any spending to access the lounge which is great for the fee but as compared toAxis Atlasthere are no lounge access for the accompanying guests in this card.

Buy 1 Get 1 on movies up to ₹200 on the District App twice per month and flat 10% off up to ₹1,000 on food ordering or booking events each once per calendar month via Zomato/District App.

Enjoy 4 complimentary rounds of golf and 12 complimentary lessons per calendar year (max 1 per calendar month). Plus, get 50% off your green fees for additional rounds.

APurchase Protection Policyon a credit card is a type of insurance that protects cardholders against theft, accidental damage, or loss of eligible purchases made with the card. It provides financial reimbursement or repair coverage for items that are damaged or stolen within a specified period after the purchase using the same credit card. The coverage is up to 180 days and ₹2,50,000 per instance.

TheHSBC TravelOne Credit Cardoffers a decent rewards structure but struggles to stand out in a highly competitive segment. Designed as a competitor toAxis Atlas, it falls short due tolimited milestone rewards, higher forex markup, restrictive exclusions, and lack of strong welcome benefits.

Currently,Axis AtlasandAMEX Platinum Travelprovide superior value for high-spenders. However, ifAxis Atlasis devalued in the future,HSBC TravelOnemay gain relevance. Until then, it remains adecent but unremarkableoption in the travel credit card market.
