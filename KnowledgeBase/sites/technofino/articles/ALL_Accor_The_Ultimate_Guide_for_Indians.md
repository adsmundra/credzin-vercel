ALL – Accor Live Limitless is the loyalty program from the Accor Group of hotels. It’s the second biggest hotel chain in the world which has a footprint in over 100 countries and more than 5,100 properties spread across its hotel brands. Accor does offer from the most exclusive and exquisite properties to the budget properties as well. It can make you awestruck with its top-of-the-line Raffles or Banyan Tree properties and also do give you the flexibility to stay at mid-range or budget hotels such as Novotel or Ibis. Accor doesn’t only show its glory in terms of the collection of properties worldwide but also does give tremendous value in terms of point value. It also offers one of the best-paid members out there which serves equally to all its guests. So let’s deep dive into it, shall we?

Accor has one of the biggest collections of hotel chains, which includes 45 brands from Super Luxury to Budget properties. Accor officially has divided the hotel brands into 4 categories. Let’s see a few of the notable mentions of the respective categories:

The ALL Accor program has 4 Elite status if the base tier is not counted. Let’s see what it requires to reach each Elite status and their benefits:

Limitless is an exclusive tier within the Accor loyalty program, accessible only by invitation to top-tier loyalists. Positioned above the Diamond Tier, it is not publicly advertised, and Accor employees are prohibited from discussing it with other guests when explaining the loyalty program.

Each calendar year, Accor’s headquarters in Paris selects individuals to receive the Limitless status and extends invitations accordingly. This status does not have specific achievement or maintenance criteria, as recipients typically already surpass certain benchmarks, such as staying over 200 nights at Accor Hotels and spending more than $100,000 annually.

Limitless status grants members a personal assistant to manage bookings and invitations to exclusive events hosted by Accor. Moreover, hotels go the extra mile to ensure Limitless members feel like VIPs, offering upgrades to unique suites and a host of additional benefits.

With just over 500 members worldwide, Limitless epitomizes exclusivity within the Accor loyalty program.

Even besides all these sweet benefits, there are quite a good amount of “brand specific benefits” that can be found on their official website.

Validity of Elite Status:

Accor Plus is a paid membership of Accor Hotels. This goes as an add-on to the Loyalty program ALL Accor. This program comes with its own added perks, such as direct discounts or lucrative perks with various coupons.

Accor Plus membership needs to be bought separately, which comes in two variants:

With Traveller membership, you can buy for another individual’s membership with the “Secondary Membership” add-on which comes at INR 4,130 per year and gives all the benefits of Traveller membership to that individual at a lower cost. So if you want a double dip, you can buy one for your spouse or close ones to enjoy the perks at a lower cost.

Some tangible benefits of these memberships are

If you’re holding anAxis Bank Reservecredit card, you’re already getting the hybrid variant of Explorer membership that gives you Silver Status (which can be earned with 10 nights of stay or 800 EUR spent) and an additional 2 nights of stay.Also, the new revamped AMEX Platinum Reserve & Platinum Charge card provides Accor Plus Traveller membership.

Also do note that not all hotels do participate in Accor Plus Program, such as in India Raffles Udaipur doesn’t participate in Accor Plus, but they do participate in ALL Accor so your Membership Tier benefits will be applicable only.

How to earn points? It’s pretty simple. You can earn by staying and paying with cash/card. But hey! We’re the points/miles enthusiast, that’s not the game we’re inclined to play.

Hotel stays do earn points and it depends on the tier. You can earn both Status Points and Reward Points. Status Points as discussed above are for migrating up to the Elite Status, but Reward Points are something you do earn. Accor does either earn or burn redemption. The earning happens per 10 EUR spent. Let’s see the table of each status

As you can see in the table, the more the ladder you climb, the more points you earn. Not only that, but the reward points and status points vary from one hotel brand to another. You’ll earn points for everything you pay for at the hotel, including spa treatments, minibar, paid TV services, and F&B.If this table confuses you and you don’t want to go through the hassle of predicting the total points earned, Accor has a great tool at your disposal to calculate it for you in a few clicks.

There are no co-branded cards with Accor. Currently. Accor has two transfer partners in India:

Accor Points can not only be earned by transfer partners such as HDFC and Axis but also can be transferred from other Loyalty Programs, which is a great way to accumulate points. There are plenty of Airline Partners but not all can be useful to transfer to Accor as you can hardly earn with them from India. Currently, there are three airline partners in India from which you’re allowed to transfer airmiles to ALL Accor:

Yes, the ratios are not great or even good either but that can only come in handy if you have thousands of points lying around to any of those frequent flyer programs and don’t have any plan to use them in the near future and have some urgent plan with Accor where you want minimal cash-burn. Though these options aren’t recommended, it’s always good to have multiple options, isn’t it?

You can earn and burn in ALL Meeting Planner which is a program where you need to enroll separately for planning Professional Planning of your events. You do earn 1 Accor Point per 2 EUR spent. These points are sharable as well, so you can share these points with other Accor members.

Not at every property you can avail of this benefit. The properties or brands you can avail of this benefit are below:

These are the 28 participating hotel brands under this program. Please do note, not all the branches of the respective brand may provide this benefit, so always do confirm with the hotel before planning.

Accor has a great valuation per point. The approximate value is1 Accor pt = ~ INR 1.8.All the Participating Accor Hotels will let you redeem your points at a denomination of40 EUR = 2,000 points. So in a multiple of 2,000 points, you can redeem it. Some hotels have also allowed you to redeem at20 EUR = 1,000 points.

The property which allows you to burn points can easily be identified with “All Points” written at the bottom right corner of their property’s name as suggested below in the screenshot.

To burn the Accor points few things to be kept in mind:

You can use ALL Accor Points to settle your Food and Beverage bill by charging it to your room during your stay at the property, redeeming points at a flat rate of 1,000 ALL Accor Points for 20 EUR.

If you’re not staying at the property, you can still pay for meals at the restaurant or bar using points, but the value is reduced to 1,000 ALL Accor Points for 10 EUR. This is not the most recommended use of points, as it only gives you half their usual value.

There are 30 Airline partners to which you can transfer your Accor Points. Note that, not all the time you’ll get a bang on value, so check and only transfer when needed. The Airlines are listed below

Not all airlines will give great value, so let’s check which one you should keep your eyes on:

Accor often lists many more events to redeem from. It varies from sports, travel, culinary, converts, etc. You can always browse through them. Some major cities in India have already seen such events. You need to keep an eye on them.

Burning these points for events has separate value. You can only consume these points at max 15% of your total bill amount (excluding tax) or 1,500 EUR whichever is lower.

There’s no blackout day for using these points so you can feel free to use them anywhere. These points don’t have any expiry.

Please do note that Accor Points’ Validity Stays/ Depends on the following:
