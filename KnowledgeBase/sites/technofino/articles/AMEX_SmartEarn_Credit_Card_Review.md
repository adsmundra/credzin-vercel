Source: https://www.technofino.in/amex-smartearn-credit-card-review

AMEX SmartEarn Credit Card is the entry-level credit card from AMEX in India designed specifically for the mass market. Though the card is not that popular but is very decent due to its accelerated reward rate on day-to-day spending and milestone benefits.

Let’s check out how we can maximize rewards on it!

Joining via referral gives you an edge as youget the 4000 welcome MR points extra which you won’t get by applying directly.

Check out the link for detailed information.

If you face any problems in the application process you can contact me onTwitter.

You can apply for any AMEX card from the link in the banner. To choose and apply for a card, simply click on theView All Cardsoption and select one. All the information for that particular card is readily available on the website.

The above-mentioned reward rate is considered if you would be transferring your points to Marriott Bonvoy or redeeming them forTajVouchers. But if you would like to redeem them for Amazon Pay vouchers then you may get much lesser value.

AMEX has aRewards Multiplierportal just likeHDFC SmartBuyfrom where you can purchase gift vouchers or do affiliate shopping and get 2X the normal reward points.

There are the following redemption options for the AMEX SmartEarn Credit Card.

AMEX allows you to take a statement credit on eligible transactions or pay with points on select merchants while entering OTP for your transaction at a value of 25p/point. Most of the new AMEX cardholders use this redemption method but trust me there can’t be a method worse than this to use your MR Points. They are much more valuable than this so kindlyignorethese two options.

Another method to redeem your MR points. With this, you can purchase flights, prepaid hotels, car rentals, and more on AmexTravel. Again this gives you a value of 25p/MR point and is highlynot recommended.

AMEX further offers you a huge variety of instant vouchers against your MR points which have different values for different brands. In this section, there are certain brand vouchers like Amazon,TAJ, BigBasket, Croma, Flipkart etc. which give better value over others and are called Gold Collection vouchers from AMEX. To redeem the gold collection you need to redeem vouchers in multiple of 18,000 or 24,000 MR points.

It is always better to hold a gold collection card likeAMEX Gold ChargeorAMEX MRCCalong with the SmartEarn so that you can redeem your MR Points for the gold collection vouchers.

Just for an idea, I have presented some values for the Gold Collection as Amazon and Taj give the highest and lowest monetary value per point. Also, keep in mind that AMEX vouchers can only be used to bookTajProperties at non-discounted rates only. Amazon voucher option is good forcashback loverswhileTajorVistaravouchers are good for those who are into travelling.

Sometimes AMEX brings upHot Rewardson particular brand voucher redemption which may give a very tempting value. You need to keep an eye on them.

Now, this is the hottest redemption option for MR points and if you can play well with this you can yield values of even greater than a rupee per point.

AMEX allows you to transfer points to 8 different airline partners and some of them are so unique that none of the Indian credit cards allows you to transfer points to them like Asia Miles. We have a curated list of all AMEX airline transfer partnershere. For booking award tickets using points, you can refer to thisposton the TechnoFino Community.

Now, this is the most sought redemption option since anyone with a Platinum or Gold status withMarriott Bonvoycan just extract a value of more than 1Re/MR point by transferring a 1:1 ratio with suite upgrades, breakfast and lounge access with complimentary drinks are an added plus. Since AMEX is the sole transfer partner to Marriott Bonvoy so many points miners use MR points only for transfer to Marriott.

Other than this you can transfer to Hilton Honors also but the value is not that great as compared to Marriott. We have curated a complete list of AMEX hotel transfer partnershere.

It takes about3-5 daysto transfer Amex MR Points to various loyalty programs so transfer them well in advance to use them.

If you spend ₹7,500 a month on all the listed merchants then you can earn 1250 MR points per month on this card. So you can easily earn 15000 MR points in a year on this card just by doing everyday spending and also get a fee waiver.Spending on theRewards Multiplierdoesn’t make much sense on this card since a 2X multiplier isn’t that exciting.

AMEX has recently started serving the following Tier 2/3 cities as well

Agra, Ajmer, Allahabad, Ambala, Amritsar, Aurangabad, Chittoor, Dehradun, Goa, Guntur, Guwahati, Jodhpur, Kanpur, Kolhapur, Kozhikode, Kurnool, Madurai, Meerut, Patiala, Raipur, Rajkot, Ranchi, Thrissur, Trichy and Udaipur.

Joining via referral gives you an edge as youget the 4000 welcome MR points extra which you won’t get by applying directly.

AMEX SmartEarn though decent doesn’t have many takers since the card becomes less meaningful if used alone. Instead of this most people take theAMEX MRCCsince the eligibility criteria are almost similar. But its value can be used in your favour by combining it with MRCC or a Gold Charge card. So, if you are not willing to commit 4L spends on an AMEX Card then you can shun theAMEX Platinum Traveland make your own AMEX Trifecta withAMEX Gold Charge,AMEX MRCCand AMEX SmartEarn.
