Review:

First of all this is entry level product from ICICI and low maintenance charges compared to other private banks. If you are looking for services then opt for different higher variant account else services will be like normal savings account in Gov. banks.  But normal SBI savings account is zero maintenance account, no charges on online transactions(IMPS,NEFT,RTGS etc), no sms charges and ATM charge is only 99+GST/Year. Still ICICI banks services are swift.

If you want credit card against ICICI insta FD a/c then better go with normal ICICI bank saving account FD where maintenance charges are different at different places( URBAN:10000, SEMI Urban:5000, Rural:2500 Gramin:1000) whereas Insta Savings and FD account have maintenance charges same everywhere. ICICI normal savings a/c and Insta Savings account have same benefits. ATM charge is 99+GST in gramin area whereas in Insta savings a/c it is 150+GST across everywhere.

Still If you have anything to ask feel free to use comment box, we are very active team.
