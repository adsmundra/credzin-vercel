Bank Of Baroda Eterna Credit Card is theflagshipoffering from their credit card division known asBOB Financial. This card costs in line with other premium cards available in the market but gives asuper premium card reward rate. This card comes on Visa Infinite and MasterCard World platforms.

I was holding a BOB Eazy Credit Card for the last 3 years and was a very early customer for them. I recently got my card upgraded to Eterna since I was using BOB cards a lot recently due to their mouthwatering online offers so that I could further sweeten the deal on all my online spending. Here’s a detailed review of this card.

Currently,BOB is running a limited-period offer and offering unconditional LTF (except Bank Of Baroda Eterna) offers on many of their cards. We are also sharing with you an exclusive referral link for allTechnoFino readers. If you think I have been able to add some value to your spending then as a token of gratitude you can go ahead by applying from our link. So what is stopping you from grabbing a BOB card?

For special MCCs, we get lesser reward points including some high-spending categories like Rent, Insurance, Utilities, and Government Transactions. Earlier these transactions were yielding rewards at 3.75% but not from now onwards.

The card is great foronline spending, travel, and dining spending. The reward rate in other categories is poor. The USP is that reward points can simply be redeemed as a statement credit for 25p per point that too without any redemption charges which is a great feature as most banks are nowadays charging for direct cash redemptions. And that 5000 Reward Point capping on the accelerated category is also very decent as compared to other BOB Cards.

If you spend₹41,700 (Online / Travel / Dining / International) per monththen you will cross the threshold of a maximum of5000 of 4X reward points and get additional 1250 points at the rate of 1X and the total becomes 6250 Reward Points. With this, you will be able to achieve theyearly milestone of 5L spending and get another 20,000 Reward Points every year. So now you have earned95K reward points worth ₹23750 on spending just₹5Lwhich makes the equivalent reward rate of a huge4.75%CASHBACK.

With the above, you also get towaive your renewal feefor the next year. I have not added the first-year milestone benefit in the above calculations.

BOB is very aggressive with its offers like 12-15% on flights/hotels via EaseMyTrip, Yatra.com, or even 5% cashback on bill payments via Amazon Pay. BOB is running a 5% cashback offer on utility bill payments for the last 2 years continuously on Amazon through which we can even book a gas cylinder at 5% off!! Even though it is a lending arm of a PSU Bank but isphenomenally aggressivewhen it comes to tie-ups with merchants.

Since the team involved is quite small so you may need a great amount of patience in dealing with their slow-to-respond customer care team.

And still, if you are not comfortable with the idea of keeping a premium paid card in your portfolio then I wouldsuggestyou go for any of its LTF cards likeBOB PremierorBOB Selectso that you canenjoy BOB’s online offers carefree.So what is stopping you from applying for aBOB credit cardwith so many benefits?
