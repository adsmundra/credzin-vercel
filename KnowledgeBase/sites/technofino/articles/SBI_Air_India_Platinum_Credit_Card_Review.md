# SBI Air India Platinum Credit Card Review

SBI Air India Platinum is the lower-end variant of theSBI Air India Signaturecard and can help you earnAir India Flying Returnsreward points directly. SBI Card and Air India have trimmed down all the features on this card including the joining fees. Let’s check out which of the two cards makes more sense for you!

The joining fees and the renewal fees in this card are well compensated by FR points and hence both the cobranded cards have low maintenance costs attached to them.

All retail spending is counted for considering milestone achievements.

On spending ₹2L in a year you will get 9,000 FR points and on spending ₹3L you will get 21,000 reward points on the retail spends which is huge and a significant jump in the reward rate. If you travel Air India frequently then by booking by booking your and your family member’s revenue tickets this reward rate can further be bumped dramatically.

Just like theSBI Air India Signaturecard getting accelerated bonus points is a big pain and I hope that the new Air India will resolve this soon.

Since the value of miles is highly dependent on many factors such as route, availability, revenue cost, time of travel and how many days you book in advance so stating a fixed value wouldn’t be justified here.

Just for an idea I would like to mention some sweet spots here and compare their revenue fares. Booking business or premium economy for domestic routes won’t make much sense since the mileage requirement is very high. For the domestic economy also the value is not that great!

The value is great for some destinations like Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam etc. For instance, DEL-HKG requires 16000 FR points for economy lite fare and revenue tickets are mostly north of ₹20,000 if you plan to fly Cathay Pacific or Vistara. Hence to derive a good value you will have to find some sweet spots by comparing them to other FFPs like Aeroplan and KrisFlyer. For such selected routes and classes this card would easily yield a reward rate close to 5-7%.

A frequent flyer program cobranded credit card without complimentary lounge access even for domestic airport lounges is quite surprising. SBI Cards should consider providing the same at least twice in six months to make this card a bit lucrative for frequent Air India travellers.

Forex markup charges are on the much higher side for a travel credit card and hence not recommended to be used overseas.

This card lacks the ethos of a travel credit card since at this fee point not providing complimentary domestic lounge access is certainly not justified. Also, forex markup is standard and very high. But if you can manage this with other cards and opt for it just for theAir India Flying Returnsreward points then it is certainly a very rewarding card. It can easily yield a minimum reward rate of 5-7% if you are flexible and can travel to certain sectors where theAir India Flying Returnscan provide you the sweet spots.

If you can spend anything above ₹5L on this card then I would strongly suggest you go for theSBI Air India Signaturecredit card which will give you the best bang for your buck.
