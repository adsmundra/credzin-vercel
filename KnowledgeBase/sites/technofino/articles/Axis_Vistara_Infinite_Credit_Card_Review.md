Axis Vistara Infinite credit card is the most elite credit card out of all the three credit cards that Axis is having in partnership with Vistara. This card for sure has the power to spoil you with all the luxury of travelling business class in India. Read on to know the benefits, how you can maximize them and also whether this card is meant for you or not!

With a business class ticket voucher being given on every renewal I would say this card is absolutely free even if you don’t use it since you will be getting a renewal benefit which is at least 2X-3X of the fee that you are paying.

Recently Axis was running a mouth-watering First-Year-Free offer on this card and I got tempted to cross the fence. As I was already having 3 Axis Cards I had to swap my Axis MyZone with this one and I am so glad I did it. I simply got a business class ticket voucher for the fee paid and then the fee also got reversed!As per my knowledge Axis only allows you to upgrade your basic cards with this one only if you have a certain threshold limit on your card. But since I am holding an Axis card for 5 years now with a decent 3.5L plus limit, it went smooth for me.

This card has one of the highest CV points earning rates among all the Vistara Cobrand credit cards on generic spending. Axis has excluded fuel spending from the reward structure butSBI Vistara Primeoffers CV points even on fuel spending which makes it a lucrative fuel card also.

Just like other Vistara co-branded cards, the real value of this card lies in its milestone benefits.

Voucher usage conditions remain the same as that of the welcome voucher as I have mentioned above. The value this card gives in the form of business-class tickets is just surreal but it depends from person to person on what exactly a person values it for.

I will suggest that you better leave the ₹12L milestone and aim for that ₹7.5L milestone to maximize your benefits. The last milestone simply doesn’t justify the value propositions that it brings. So if you hit that ₹7.5L milestone then you will get

With 32K CV points, you can get a return economy ticket from Delhi to Male or Mumbai to Dubai which approximately costs ₹26,000 for a revenue ticket. And if you are flying domestic then a Delhi-Bengaluru return flight will set you apart with 15K CV points.  The 4 business class domestic flight vouchers are worth a minimum of ₹25-30K each even if we are taking a conservative value like for the Delhi-Bengaluru flight. With three one-class upgrade vouchers, the total benefits are worth ₹1.5L and the equivalent reward rate come out to be a whopping 15%! even if you factor in the taxes you will be paying for booking these redemption tickets.

But as I said earlier if you are not a regular business class traveller then you will probably value it very differently.

I hope now you can imagine the value that it gives to you. And you can also use these vouchers and points for your family and friends by adding them as a nominee in your Club Vistara Account. Also, you don’t pay any convenience fee for the booking from their official site.

One gets a complimentary Vistara CV Gold membership till you hold an active card which offers you a host of benefits like priority boarding, priority check-in, 10Kg extra baggage allowance, and likes.

It also gives you 10 Club Vistara Points for every ₹100 that you spend on Vistara flights. As a Gold member, you are also entitled to Vistara Priority Connect.

Cover of 300$ for the following.

If you are a regular business-class traveller on any airline then you can consider shifting your loyalty to Vistara if your city is serviced by them. The value that this card offers in the form of flight redemptions is just too good and makes this card a no-brainer.

Since there are direct flights to most of the cities from Delhi and Mumbai so they can be called as the hub for Vistara. So people living in these cities must hold a Vistara CoBranded card for the value it offers. For other cities you have to do your own calculations about the route on which you travel regularly.

But to extract that value you will have to spend 7.5L plus the joining fees and the taxes for the four business class redemption flights taken. So for people who travel economy, it’s important to evaluate it yourself since the value perception differs for everyone. And if it is not making much sense to you then you can explore Axis Vistara Platinum or Signature cards.

But if you are willing to live these kinds of new experiences in life then you can consider holding one. And if you are travelling business class using these redemptions then you also get eligible for exclusive business class lounges at certain airports.How has been your experience with Vistara Business Class?
