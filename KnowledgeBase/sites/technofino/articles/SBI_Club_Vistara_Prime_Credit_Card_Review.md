SBI Club Vistara Prime is a premium travel credit card from SBI but earlier this was available only on the MasterCard platform and due to the ban SBI wasn’t able to issue this card. But now since it’s available on the VISA Signature platform this card is becoming popular again among Vistara loyalists. Read on to know the benefits and how to maximize them.

With a premium economy ticket voucher being given on every renewal I would say this card is absolutely free even if you don’t use it since you will be getting a renewal benefit which is at least 2X-3X of the fee that you are paying. The perks offered on this card are too good at the given fee range.

I guess the above table must have not given you that excitement. But the real value of this card lies in its milestone benefits.

So if you hit that₹8L milestonethen you will get

With 16K CV points, you can fly from Delhi to Male or Mumbai to Dubai which approximately costs ₹13,000 for a revenue ticket, and with the remaining 3K CV points, you can get a short route domestic ticket worth approx ₹2-3K. The 4 domestic flight vouchers are worth ₹10K each even if we are taken a conservative value like for the Delhi-Bengaluru flight.

With the ₹10K Yatra voucher and One-class upgrade voucher the total benefits are worth around ₹70K and the equivalent reward rate come out to be a whopping8.5%! even if you factor in the taxes you will be paying for booking redemption tickets.

I hope now you can imagine the value that it gives to you. And you can also use these vouchers and points for your family and friends by adding them as a nominee in your Club Vistara Account. Also, you don’t pay any convenience fee for the booking from their official site.

One gets a complimentary Vistara CV Silver membership till you hold an active card which offers you a host of benefits like priority boarding, priority check-in, 5Kg extra baggage allowance, and likes. It also gives you 9 Club Vistara Points for every ₹200 that you spend on Vistara flights.

It’s the only travel credit card in India that gives youcancellation insurancein which you can cancel 6 Vistara flight tickets per year each limited to ₹3500 for free. This concept is very interesting.

Since India has limited full-service carriers, I highly recommend this card to anyone who is living in a city serviced by Vistara and is a frequent flier. An 8.5% reward rate is exceptionally good and other perks of holding a Vistara Silver Tier membership are extra. I rate this card a notch above Axis Vistara Signature due to the last milestone which requires 1 lakh lesser as compared to Axis and you get a Yatra voucher extra. The interesting part is, that you get points even on fuel spending.SBI generally does not have cards catering to HNIs but after the launch of SBI Aurum, I guess they can launch a card that gives business class vouchers just like Axis Vistara Infinite.I am holding this card in my family but also planning to close my SBI Octane (since I already have another Octane in my family) and apply for this card. But since the process is not direct and I would have to go for a new application, so I haven’t taken the move yet. So if you are already holding three SBI cards like me then the process is a bit difficult to acquire this card but if your count is two then simply go ahead and apply for this card directly.What are your thoughts on the SBI Vistara credit cards?
