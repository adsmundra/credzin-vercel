# Axis Reserve Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/axis-reserve-credit-card-review

Axis Reserve is the big brother ofAxis Magnusand was the second most sought-after card among CC enthusiasts due to its exceptional reward rate till recently. Till 2021 no one would have ever thought that Axis would bring a storm in the credit card industry and outpace all its competitors and even giants like AMEX, HDFC and Citi with such good earning rates and even better redemption partners!Getting a card worth ₹60K? Are you outta your mind? This was the first thing that I had got to hear when I told my family members that I had applied for Axis Reserve. One of the most UHNI cards available in India right now. I took the plunge last October just before I had an international vacation planned and continuing till now.

But does this card still have some juice left that makes it worth the fees? Let’s check it out!

Technofino Tip– Always spend in multiples of ₹200 to maximize your earning especially when buying vouchers from Gift Edge or Grab Deals.Add smaller denominations like Swiggy/KFC to round the payable amount.

So as you can see first three redemptions won’t fetch you much value. Hence this card is basically a travel-oriented card in which the value can only be extracted if you consider transferring your points to the partner hotel and airlines. Even going by the conservative value of ₹0.80 per point (ITC Transfers) the reward rate comes out to around 4.8% flat and if you are into the miles game then you can take this value anywhere depending on your expertise.

Total EDGE Reward Points that can be converted to Partner Points in a calendar year is capped at 5,00,000 EDGE Reward Points per customer ID. For the year 2023, customers can convert 5,00,000 EDGE Reward Points from 1st September 2023– 31st December 2023.

Axis Reserve offers no milestone benefits which is highly surprising for this fee point.

I would call this a one-stop credit card for you and your entire family for airport lounge access that too anywhere in the world.

Also, you can access some select domestic lounges using the Priority Pass offered by Reserve then the charges are reversed later on. Earlier the bank was allowing to access all domestic lounges in India complimentary using Priority Pass.

How about a luxury (Merc/BMW/Audi) chauffeured car standing right outside your home ready to take you to the airport for your next flight that too for free? Welcome to the world ofLuxury Airport Transfers. Axis Bank is giving this facility on Reserve in a tie-up withDreamFolks Services.In my opinion, the number of transfers is quite low if compared to the fee paid for this card.

Airport Meet and Greet also known as an airport concierge service is the USP of this product since only a very limited set of cards in India are providing this service. In this service, you get a dedicated person right at the gate to take care of all your luggage by providing a dedicated buggy and a porter service. With this, they also provide check-in via express counters, security checks via Business class sections and also immigration assistance even if you are travelling economy.

Since Magnus is providing the same I had expected Axis Bank to at least provide double the access on this card!

This card provides a toned-down version ofClub ITC Culinaireand doesn’t offer the Free Night Stay instead they give a 3rd night stay on booking two revenue nights. It also offers just 1 room upgrade voucher instead of two. But it does provide two 50% and 20% off F&B Vouchers each.

Axis offers automatic enrolment to the Silver Tier membership ofAccor Pluswhich comes with various benefits and which is generally achievable by spending 800 € which is roughly around 70,000 INR.

Axis Bank Reserve Credit Card entitles you to 50 complimentary rounds of golf games or lessons every year at some of the most premium golf destinations in the country. Never tried this but would soon give it a shot!

This card provides Buy 1 Get 1 on Movies and Events for a maximum of up to ₹500 and ₹1,000 per ticket respectively on bookings made on BookMyShow that too 5 times a month. Other than this you can also use the Visa Infinite benefits on this card. The availability for the Magnus offer is better than the Visa Infinite offer since the quota looks huge.

Complimentary membership of theEazydiner Primedining program under which you up to 25% off plus a 40% card discount up to ₹1,000 at premium restaurants across the country. It is one of my favourite benefits on both Reserve and Magnus which I eagerly look forward to enjoying while dining out with my friends and family at fancy places.

A 1% fuel surcharge waiver at all the fuel stations for transactions ₹400 to ₹4000 with a maximum surcharge waiver of ₹400 per month.

This card provides a reduced forex markup charge of only 1.5% + GST and with an accelerated reward rate of 6% on international spending this card is the crown prince for forex spending!

Comprehensive insurance cover including purchase protection up to ₹2L, a 500 USD cover for loss/delay in baggage. Also, you are provided with an Air Accidental Insurance of ₹4.5Cr and complete lost card liability lies with the bank in case you misplace the card.

With the recent brutal devaluations on this card, I would say Axis Bank has killed this card. But if you still have considerable forex spends and value the Accor Stay Plus nights and other perks that come along with this card then this card still makes some sense.
