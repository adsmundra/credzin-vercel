I had credit card, For late fee and interest charges they charged Rs.2300/- and it cant be reversed as per their system/policy. Other vendors can reverse the charge easily. I cancelled the card immediately. Interest charges are more here in ICICI.. please consider before applying the same.
Not satisfied with the outstanding amount they show in the bill evey month. Although i was clearing  all my dues but still they are charging something and you would always have an outstanding amount on the date to be paid. They do not even give any clarity that how much paid vs how much is pending so that customers do not have anything to defend and show them with proof. Customer care people do not respond back in a proper manner. Not satisfied with the services. Stopping to use.
There are a few issues on the ICICI Bank app. But regardless the card is good. Best thing to do is to pay the amount due in one go and ignore the current outstanding.
This card has stopped giving cashback for wallet load like Paytm etc., Please check the details before you apply for the card.
What are the interest rates for long-term users of ICICI, and how much time is given to the user to pay the bill?
Interest rates charged for Amazon ICICI Credit Card is 3.5% – 3.8% per month. You would be getting a billing cycle of 50 days.
Can we still apply for this card??
Yes, applications for the Amazon ICICI Credit Card are being taken.
Great for Amazon shoppers, but keep in mind the 5% discount applies only if you pay the full amount
I have the Amazon Pay CC, does anyone know if it qualifies as a Visa “platinum” card though?
Great overview of the Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card! I love how it offers cashback on Amazon purchases, plus the added benefits for other shopping categories. It really seems like a fantastic option for frequent Amazon shoppers. Thanks for the detailed insights!
Is it possible to avail other icici bank offers using this card? Because SBI Cashback card can’t be used for other offers from the bank."

ICICI Bank Parakram Credit Card Review
The ICICI Bank Parakram Credit Card is solely dedicated to the needs of the defence personnel. Just like any other credit card, this card helps in case of emergencies and gets you value back on your expenses. However, since its sole purpose is to fulfill the needs of the individuals and families related to defence, the reward program is made in a way that allows the benefits to be obtained while purchasing from the CSDs. Since most defence families prefer CSDs rather than general stores, this reward system is quite overwhelming.
Looking at the market competitors of this credit card, Axis Bank and SBI Bank are some of the few credit cards dedicated to defense personnel in the market. These credit cards give fierce competition to this credit card. However, every credit card has one thing that is better than the other. This is what needs to be evaluated to find out the best-suited one for you.

ICICI Bank previously issued the MakeMyTrip ICICI Bank Signature and Platinum Credit Cards. These have now been canceled and cannot be applied for. Only the current MakeMyTrip ICICI Bank Credit Card is valid.
Bottom Line
MakeMyTrip is a well-known platform for booking family trips, vacations, weekend getaways, honeymoons, and more. Whether it’s flights, hotels, cabs, or buses, MakeMyTrip offers the best deals and prices. The MakeMyTrip ICICI Bank Credit Card is a versatile travel co-branded credit card with multiple travel-focused features. The only requirement is that all bookings and expenses must be made through MakeMyTrip to ensure you earn the highest rewards.
This card offers plenty of domestic airport lounge visits, but the number of international lounge visits is limited to just one, and both are only valid for the primary cardholder. One of the best features of this card is the low Forex markup charge of 0.99%, which is beneficial for making international purchases. The reward-based system is only good if you make spends on MakeMyTrip. Basically, only those who make spends with the online travel booking platform can fully take advantage of this card.
For those who book their travel through MakeMyTrip, this is the perfect card, especially considering that the previously issued MMT ICICI co-branded credit cards have now been discontinued.

With its numerous benefits and high reward rates, it attracts a lot of expectations, especially given its substantial annual fee of ₹20,000. While the card excels in some areas, it has not lived up to the expectations of many credit card enthusiasts. Features like airport transfer by helicopter are truly exceptional but are limited by location (Bangalore Airport). The 2.5% reward rate for international spending is appreciated, but at the same time, the 1.49% Forex markup charge is not.
The Times Black ICICI Credit Card is ideal for individuals with high spending habits, frequent domestic and international travel, and a strong appreciation for fine dining, events, and shopping. To fully utilize the advantages of this card, one should be in the top tier in terms of income and expenditure.

From its stylish design to the exclusive luxury benefits, one standout feature is the airport transfers by helicopter, which is truly amazing.
