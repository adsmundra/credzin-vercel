Investors have started showing interest in fixed deposits because of the rising interest rates.
Small finance banks are offering better interest rates than commercial banks. Au Small Finance Bank, Jana Small Finance bank, Capital Small Finance Bank, Fincare Small Finance Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank, ESAF Small Finance Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank are few of the Small Financial Banks operating in our country.
These banks offer higher interest rates to investors to increase their client base.
## What Is a Small Finance Bank?
Small finance banks are a type of niche bank in our country. Like other commercial banks, these banks can carry on basic banking activities of lending and taking.
The objective behind these banks is to provide services to those sections of the society who are not being served by other banks, such as small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and unorganized sector entities.
The main purpose of having small finance banks is to provide better access to financial services to the underbanked sections of society like laborers, the low-income section, small businesses, and other unorganized sector entities.
Small Finance Banks have a mandate to have a higher proportion of their lending to priority sectors.

## Challenges Faced
### **1.Fear Among Investors**
Despite higher interest rates offered by small finance banks, many people remain cautious of opening fixed deposit accounts with them fearing the stability of such banks.
People do not know that just like other commercial banks, small finance bank depositors are also covered under the depositor insurance program of the DICGC and up to Rs. 1 lakhs invested by an investor is insured in those small finance banks that come under DICGC.
### **2.Lack of Awareness**
There is a lack of awareness among retail investors about the higher interest rate offered by these small finance banks.
### **3.Accessibility**
Many retail investors avoid investing in these banks because of the unavailability of bank branches near their place of residence.
## Conclusion
If we are willing to invest our savings into fixed deposits of these small finance banks then we can diversify our portfolio by investing in it.
We have the option to compare the interest rates offered by different small finance banks by going through the interest rate charts given above and then decide for ourselves which bank to open a savings account or fixed deposit accounts in.
