**IPO vs Mutual Funds** If you have no knowledge of the equity markets but are looking to gain from the equity markets, mutual funds are ideal. Investments can be made in Mutual Funds since they provide a wide variety and also the amount of investment can vary as per investor’s preference.
Many mutual funds invest in IPOs – many times at discounted rates that are not available to retail investors.
It is necessary to not get carried away by the hype surrounding IPOs. Don’t jump into IPO if you do not have the necessary skills.
In a mutual fund, a skilled and trained professional handles all investments for you and therefore, you can benefit from the equity markets without spending too much time gaining the skills needed to understand the markets.
## **Different Funds:**
  * **Large Cap Funds** – Here the investment is made in large cap companies. These companies offer 12-18% return. Moderate risk is involved and it is suggested to invest here for 4 years or more.
  * **Mid Cap Funds** – Here the investment is made in mid cap companies. These companies are offer 15-20% return. Moderately high risk is involved and it is suggested to invest here for 5 years or more.
  * **Small Cap Funds** – Here the investment is made in small cap companies. These companies offer 15-20% return. High risk is involved and it is suggested to invest here for 6 years or more.
  * **Balanced Fund** – This fund is a combination of equity and debt in its portfolio. Depending on the proportion of investment made in Equity and Debt, the risk and returns are accordingly determined. It is suggested to invest here for 2 to 3 years. Returns in this fund range from 11-14%.


Investment can be made via lump sum investment or through SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) mode in any of these funds.
Moreover return is something that cannot be promised but these return estimates have been given on the basis of past performance. **Mutual Funds for 2018** **Large Cap Fund:**
These funds invest in large companies that have a history of good performance and stable balances.
  * [SBI Bluechip Fund](https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-bluechip-fund-growth)


**Mid Cap Fund:**
These are funds that are high risk – high return. They’re a bit riskier than large cap funds.
  * [Aditya Birla Small & Midcap Fund](https://groww.in/mutual-funds/birla-sun-life-small-midcap-fund-growth)


**Small Cap Fund:**
These are the funds that you can invest in if you want very high growth. They are very high risk too.
