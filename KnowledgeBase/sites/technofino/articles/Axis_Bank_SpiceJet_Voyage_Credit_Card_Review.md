# Axis Bank SpiceJet Voyage Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-spicejet-voyage-credit-card-review

The Axis Bank is out again with all guns blazing. It has recently launched two co-branded credit cards surprisingly in collaboration with SpiceJet namely SpiceJet Voyage and SpiceJet Voyage Black. Axis Bank and SpiceJet are a deadly combination as the customer service of both of them is poor.

The general buzz about this card is not that great due to another Axis Bank debacle of crediting lower cashback with their recently launched Axis Airtel Credit Card. Here is a detailed overview of both the cards with my recommendation at the end of the article.

Voyage Black is the premium version of the twin SpiceJet cards.

The joining fee is well compensated with the welcome voucher but annual fees are not being justified by giving half the value worth of SpiceClub points.

Reward rates are really very poor for general spending if you think from the view that they can only be redeemed for travel. Even if you are a frequent flier then booking a SpiceJet flight from an OTA will give you better rewards.

The milestone benefit does jack up the rate nearly by 1% but even after that reward rate is too poor.

Cardholder gets a complimentary SpiceClub Golden Tier Membership with a host of benefits.

A 1% fuel surcharge waiver of up to ₹400 per statement cycle, across all fuel stations in India. GST on fuel surcharge will be non-refundable.

For Salaried Indian NationalAge: Min 18 years & Max 70 Years,No mention of income criteria on the Axis Bank website for this card.

Again for this card joining fee is well compensated but paying the annual fee makes no sense.

Again a dismal reward rate across the spending areas and milestone benefits also make no sense.

Even if you will be able to hit the milestone then also reward rate remains poor.

1% fuel surcharge waiver of up to ₹400 per statement cycle, across all fuel stations in India. GST on fuel surcharge will be non-refundable.

For Salaried Indian NationalAge: Min 18 years & Max 70 Years,No mention of income criteria on the Axis Bank website for this card.

The reward rates on both cards are too poor for any recommendations. Even for spending on SpiceJet, the reward rate is extremely poor. For online bill payments, food delivery, online entertainment and everything else I therefore recommend using a cashback card likeAxis Aceor Axis Flipkart and using the cashback earned to book tickets using OTAs which will give you added flexibility.

Every card issuer must apply a basic sense that you just can’t give a reward rate which is lower than cashback cards when redemption is limited only to flights. I mean it makes much more sense to get a flat cashback card than to get a lower reward rate and go for a fixed travel redemption. Vistara has done it much better with Axis Vistara Infinite andSBI Vistara Prime.

The second main factor in avoiding this card is the brand SpiceJet. The SpiceClub membership is not that value-driven as compared to Club Vistara Plus since there are no business class seats in SpiceJet hence you can’t get an upgrade and fly business. So all in all it’s not the card for anyone who flies business class domestically.

Plus the SpiceMax program is not up to the mark for the cost they ask for it. All you get is better legroom and first-row seats in the aircraft plus the discipline related to priority check-in and boarding is hardly observed by ground staff for SpiceMax customers. Indigo is much better when it comes to services, VFM and customer care. So these SpiceJet cards are a big no from my side.
