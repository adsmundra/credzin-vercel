IndusInd Bankrecently launched another cobranded card in collaboration with EazyDiner on a Visa Platinum platform. This new card is Lifetime Free and hence a toned-down version of the earlier launchedIndusInd EazyDiner Signature.

EazyDiner is a dine-out application which helps you get great dining deals in India and the UAE. With this, you canbook tables at your nearbyfine dining and or even fast-food chains.

Let’s check out all that this card brings to the table!

Contents

You get a 3-monthEazyDiner Prime Membershipalong with the IndusInd Bank EazyDiner Platinum card which will get renewed if you spend ₹30,000 in 90 days.

EazyPoints are earned differently than the Reward Points on the EazyDiner application. You can earn EazyPoints by doing the following

Out of all the above ways, you will get 2X EazyPoints on the Book a Table Feature only, and the rest of the earning rate will be as usual. If you are a non-prime member you are entitled to 25 EazyPoints per diner on booking a table so with this card you will receive 50 EazyPoints per diner.

You can get 2000 Reward Points upon spending ₹30,000 on categories other than dining every 90 days. The effective value of these points is ₹400 (~1.33%) and can be used to slash your dining bills.

You can earn rewards in two different forms that areReward Points and EazyPointsbut thecurrency is a single entity called EazyPoints. Now the interesting part is that theredemption process for both of them is different. Both points will be visible separately in your application once you have the card linked to your application.

For redemption, you have the following options.

EazyPointswhen redeemed for a meal voucher gives you avalue of 20p eachand has a minimum spending condition. A200 voucher comes with a 1000 minimum billingcondition. Soredemptions for meal vouchers are pointlesssince you won’t be able to 20%-40% club card discounts with them and points would simply go to waste.

You can also redeem EazyPoints for a night’s stay in select juSTa Resorts in Dharamshala and Shimla if you pay for the other night. A night at juSTa Birding Dharamshala starts from 5K a night whereas juSTa Cliffend Resort & Spa Mashobra Shimla costs around 7.5K with the same redemption requirements.

Further if luxury is your cup of tea, then Postcard Hotel (India/ Sri Lanka/ Bhutan) redemption option is also there, starting from 20K EazyDiner points. But there is a condition of paying the full amount for the first night and then the second night becomes complimentary.

To get themaximumout of EazyDiner points Irecommend you accumulate them and use them for hotel redemptions.

Now,PayEazyis a payment channel provider that helps you pay the restaurant bill. This helps you make a transaction with any debit or credit card and other popular payment gateways and enjoy offers and discounts from their payment partners. You have to keep in mind that not all restaurants available on EazyDiner give Prime benefits and also not all the Prime restaurants are PayEazy enabled. So for a maximum savings combination, a restaurant should be aPayEazy-enabled Prime restaurant.

So a bill of ₹2,000 in a restaurant gets an EazyDiner discount of let’s say, 25% and becomes₹1,500 and then becomes₹1,200 instantly on paying via EazyPay with this card!

Here’s how you can avail of maximum discount when you dine in with your IndusInd EazyDiner Credit Card

New to EazyDiner?Download theapplicationand use the referral code:BHAVY9104 to get a ₹500 worth voucher.

All overseas transactions are levied with a 3.5% + GST transaction fee.

Enjoy a 1% fuel surcharge waiver across all fuel stations in India. This waiver applies for all fuel transactions between ₹400 to ₹4000. Since the bank has mentioned no capping on this card I think it’s anunlimited fuel surcharge waiver.

Currently, this card is being issued only to people who don’t hold any IndusInd Credit Card and can be applied from the EazyDiner portal. If you already hold an IndusInd card then you can only apply for the signature version.

I would easily say that EazyDiner has again nailed it with their IndusInd Bank EazyDiner Platinum Card just like its highly popular Signature version which has been a hit among foodies. At the same time, many people didn’t take the card due to a fee of roughly ₹2500 annually. Although the BookMyShow offer and other benefits of the card easily outweigh the annual fees still from the perspective of people who didn’t dine out much the card was not plunge-worthy.

Now coming to this card I would say that this card must be in your wallet if you dine out once in a while and your favourite restaurant is listed on the EazyDiner app. The features of the card have been very well designed for this to qualify as a cobranded card since only the value-added features have been removed when compared to the signature version. This card is built for people who have just started earning and are looking for an LTF card which can give them some great value on their small ticket-size cafe expeditions.The only thing which I feel dampens this card slightly is the thrice-a-month discount limit on the dining bills since many other EazyPay partner banks are providing discounts even four times a month. Being a cobranded card it could have covered a weekend every week by giving instant discounts at least 4-5 times a month.Are you planning to get hold of this IndusInd EazyDiner card?
