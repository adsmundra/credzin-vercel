You decide to buy a used car. You transfer the car's registration certificate to your name, and that's it!
_But wait! You skipped an important step! You forgot the insurance transfer from the previous owner._
Ensuring a successful **car insurance transfer** to the new buyer is essential to selling a car for the buyer and the seller. Unfortunately, most consumers need help transferring an existing car insurance policy. Hence, continue reading to discover **how to transfer car insurance to new owner**.
## **Understanding Car Insurance Transfer**
As you may know, four-wheeler insurance financially safeguards a vehicle against unexpected risks such as road accidents, thefts, etc. Therefore, keeping the car insurance policy is pointless if you no longer own the car.
As a result, when you sell your car, you must guarantee that the new owner's four-wheeler insurance policy is passed to their name. Likewise, if you are buying a used car, ensure the previous owner transfers the existing motor insurance policy to you.
Car Insurance Transfer formalizes the withdrawal of one party from an insurance policy agreement following the approval of another party. Notably, according to Section 157 of the Motor Vehicles Act, both parties must transfer car insurance policies within 14 days of procurement.
## **How to Transfer Car Insurance?**
As a buyer, you should take the initiative to insure your car or motorcycle with a motor insurance policy. Yet, according to the law established by the transport department, the seller must guarantee the insurance transfer to the buyer.
Transferring car insurance is a simple process. But first, it's vital to understand the documentation needed to transfer the title when purchasing a used car-
  * Registration Certificate.
  * Car insurance policy


Submit a transfer request to the motor insurance provider to transfer an existing automobile insurance policy from one individual to another. 
_Now that you know what documents are required to transfer vehicle ownership, let's go over the**Steps for insurance transfer to your name** -_
**Steps** |  **Details**  
---|---  
Step 1 |  Download Forms 28, 29, and 30 from the RTO's website or office.  
Step 2 |  Fill out the form and submit it to the RTO with all the relevant paperwork (if any).  
Step 3 |  Procure the Clearance Certificate from the RTO for the completed forms and proof of sale.  
Step 4 |  Provide all required documents to the insurance company.  
Step 5 |  Pay the applicable fee (if any).  
Step 6 |  Get the policy bearing your name via email or courier.  
## **Documents Required to Transfer Insurance**
Together with a transfer fee, the following documents are needed for car insurance transfer-
  * New Registration Certificate/Form 29
  * Old Vehicle Insurance Policy Documents
  * Former policyholder's No Objection Clause (NOC)
  * New Application Form
  * Inspection Report (carried out by insurance company)
  * No Claims Bonus Difference Sum


If your Regional Transport Office (RTO) extends ownership transference in the registration certificate, you can apply for a **car insurance name transfer** along with the other paperwork.
Any insurance company, however, would only settle claims if they get hold of the transfer of registration certificate. As a result, you must send it to the insurance company as soon as you receive a new RC.
**_Interesting Fact to Know-_** **_The 1st auto insurance policy was issued in the year 1897._**  
---  
## **RTO Documents Required for Car Ownership Transfer**
The following RTO documents are required for transferring ownership of the vehicle.
**Document** |  **Details**  
---|---  
Form 28 |  This form is an application to secure the NOC from the applicable RTO.It also proves that the seller is no longer liable for the car, which could block the transfer of ownership.  
Form 29 |  It serves as a notice to the registering authority or RTO that the previous owner is selling the car. In addition, the seller has turned over all vehicle documentation to the buyer, including the registration certificate, insurance policy, and Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate.  
Form 30 |  This form is an acknowledgment of Form 29 that the car's ownership must be transferred. Furthermore, the seller has passed the buyer all legal rights and responsibilities associated with the car.  
Clearance Certificate |  This document is necessary if you transfer the car from one RTO to another inside or out of the state. It holds details about the buyer's and seller's credentials and vehicle details.  
## **Reasons Why Transfer of Car Insurance is Required**
There are two significant reasons for the need to transfer the Car Insurance Policy-
  * ### **To Avoid Any Prospective Liabilities**


If an accident with your used car leads to third-party liabilities, you cannot file a third-party claim because the previous owner did not transfer the policy to your name. As a result, you will be on your own to settle off your third-party liabilities.
  * ### **To Keep Your No Claim Bonus**


The No Claim Bonus is critical from a seller's viewpoint. A No Claim Bonus rewards prudent policyholders who have yet to file a claim in a calendar year.
NCB is available in the form of savings on your damage premium. The longer you go without a claim on your auto insurance coverage, the higher the premium discount you are entitled to.
## **Things to Keep in Mind While Transferring Car Insurance**
  * The vehicle's registration number code will not accurately represent the original RTO. For example, look at the back of the RC in the lower right corner, where the RTO is mentioned.
  * Every RTO can register new vehicles. However, the process for transferring ownership differs slightly. The transfer of ownership application should be submitted to the RTO for the buyer's residence area.
  * Form 28, often known as a No Objection Certificate (NOC), is not required when transferring ownership inside the state. Instead, the seller's CC is necessary. When transferring ownership between states, three originals of Form 28 are required.
  * Every second Saturday of the month, RTOs may be closed.
  * On Saturdays, cash desks at RTOs may close at noon.
  * It is critical to make copies of all documents and bring the originals with you. Organizing the documents as needed will save you much time.
  * Keep some stationary on hand, such as pens, whitener, glue, staplers, etc., for last-minute updates/corrections.


## **Conclusion**
Transferring car ownership can be simple if you take the appropriate measures. However, whether you are the buyer or the seller, you should keep copies of any important documents for future reference.
