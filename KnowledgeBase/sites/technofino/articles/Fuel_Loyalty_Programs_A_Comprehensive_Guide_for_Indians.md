Here’s a comprehensive guide about all the fuel loyalty programs running in India by the various OMCs which might be helpful for some people who have substantial fuel spending every month.

Previously I had shared a detailed article onBest Credit Cards for Fuel Spends in Indiawhich can help you choose the best fuel credit card and I recommend that you read the article before this one for a better understanding. In this article, we will suggest to you the best ways to pump up the reward rate by a tiny margin in combination with the fuel cards recommended in the above-mentioned article. So let’s check out all the details!

Indian Oil offers a loyalty program for its individual and corporate(SmartFleet) customers. Its SmartFleet card is not recommended for individual users due to its 80,000 minimum points redemption condition though its reward rate is comparatively higher than XtraRewards Card.

I am highlighting features of its individual program called XtraRewards in which I am also enrolled and was earning good rewards before I switched to SBI BPCL Octane Credit Card. With this card, all you have to do is to swipe the physical card if you have or quote the registered mobile number with IOCL to the attendant so that he punches in the EDC to get the XtraReward Points. Don’t forget to ask for a slip for the points punched!

XtraRewards card when swiped in combination with co-brand cards like HDFC IOCL & AXIS IOCL cards can further pump up the reward rate and give you 5.2% and 4.4% respectively.

HP Pay previously known as HP Refuel is a loyalty and payments program from HPCL. This program can be used from a unified mobile application that can be used to utilize all the services related to automotive fuel, LPG refills, and lubes. This mobile app accepts payment via almost all payment methods. You can either load the inbuilt wallet or pay directly and as per my personal experience, the process is seamless.

Before you start doing your calculations let me tell you the dealbreaker in this. HPCL charges wallet loading charges with credit cards. I am also mentioning the charges underneath which simply negates the reward that you will earn via PAYBACK. Another point worth mentioning here is that ICICI HPCL Co-brand credit cards won’t give you any surcharge waiver benefit due to the physical ICICI POS condition attached to them. So there is no question of using credit cards on the HP Pay app due to loading charges and lack of surcharge reversal except for the ones listed below.

Certain cards offer 6 Payback points on loading an inbuilt wallet in the HPCL Pay app.BOB HPCL Energie,HPCL Supersaver credit card,andUni Bank Carbon credit cardare the best use cases possible in the case of HPCL as they both offer a net5.5% reward ratewhen routed through the HP Pay app. Additionally, the fuel surcharge waiver will equalize the wallet loading charges. Further, you can swipe your Payback card additionally and get a Payback point per ₹100 spent.

Hello BPCL is the loyalty program of Bharat Petroleum in India also known as SmartDrive earlier. BPCL awards Petrolmiles on loading the integrated wallet.

Earlier BPCL was giving points on loading this wallet with SBI cobranded cards but that has stopped now so no such combination exists for this loyalty program. The only combination I can think of is Standard Chartered Super Value Titanium but the hassle is not worth the reward.
