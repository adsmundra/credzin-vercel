##### ** _(The stocks mentioned in the blog are as per Analyst Ratings and Market Capitalisation)_**
The ethanol sector in India is a crucial player in the country's energy market that drives both economic activity and environmental sustainability. Over the past few years, there’s been an increasing focus on tapping renewable energy sources to help reduce the country’s dependency on fossil fuels.
India imports about 80% of its crude oil (fossil fuel) requirements, making it vital to focus on renewable energy sources to meet the country’s expanding energy needs and to protect its foreign exchange reserves. Ethanol is a key element in this emerging equation.
Given the rising quest for renewable energy sources, stocks of companies producing ethanol are gaining popularity among investors seeking opportunities to be a part of the growing green energy market.
In this blog, we will explore some of the top ethanol stocks in India that are gaining popularity among investors.
## **Ethanol Industry in India - A Brief Overview**
Ethanol is produced from sugarcane, maize, and other materials rich in cellulose. It is used as a fuel additive in the transportation sector. Petrol and diesel are being increasingly blended with ethanol for use as a renewable alternative fuel. The other big industry where this versatile chemical compound finds extensive use is the alcohol industry.
Ethanol is used to produce alcoholic spirits of all types. It is produced by the fermentation of the yeast in the sugar contained in sugarcane, fruits, grains, and other sources of starch. This fermentation provides intoxicating effects to alcohol.
Ethanol finds use in other industries, too. These include paints, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, personal care products, cleaning products, and plastics.
Ethanol has been used as fuel since the early 1900s to improve fuel quality and reduce pollution. In the 1970s, India began producing ethanol from sugarcane mainly for industries. During the early 2000s, the Indian government decided to use ethanol as a renewable fuel, and since then, India's ethanol production and use have been increasing steadily. Going forward, ethanol usage in India is set to rise due to increased demand for biofuel and alcoholic beverages.
According to news reports, India has reached the 15% level for ethanol blending in its fuel mix as of May 2024. India now plans to raise this to 20% ethanol blending by 2025, compared to the previous deadline of 2030, a target set by the National Policy on Biofuel (NPB), 2018. Accordingly, oil marketing companies (OMCs) have to procure ethanol made out of B heavy molasses, C heavy molasses, sugar, sugar syrup, sugarcane juice, damaged foodgrains that are not fit for human consumption, surplus foodgrains, and fruit and vegetable wastes.
India’s ethanol market size was estimated at $6.51 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to a size of $10.45 billion by 2029, marking a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.84%. 
Thus, the country's shift towards ethanol-mixed fuels, rising investments in agriculture to grow crops from which ethanol can be produced, and government incentives are driving growth in the ethanol sector. 
### **Process of Producing Ethanol from Sugarcane**
The first step in the process of ethanol manufacturing is to crush the sugarcane stalks and extract juice, which is rich in sugar.
This juice is then collected and moved to a fermentation tank, where yeast fermentation is done. 
The final fermented product will contain between 5% and 12% ethanol. Finally, using molecular sieves, the fuel-grade ethanol is separated from the water.

  * ### **Dwarikesh Sugar Industries**


Incorporated in the year 1993, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Limited is a producer of sugar, ethanol, power, sanitisers, bagasse, fertilisers, pesticides, molasses, and many other products. 
Dwarikesh Sugar works with around 1.54 lakh sugarcane farmers across three locations spanning more than 1.17 lakh hectares. Its sugarcane procurement amounts to approximately 382 lakh quintals. Its primary manufacturing units are located in Uttar Pradesh at Bundki village, Bahadurpur village in Dhampur Tehsil, and Faridpur Tehsil in Bareilly District. It has operations in other parts of India too, such as Maharashtra, Delhi, and Rajasthan.
**Particulars** |  **FY24** |  **FY23** |  **Change (%)** |  **Q1 FY25** |  **Q1 FY24** |  **Change (%)**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Revenue (Rs Cr) |  1,709.50 |  2102.9 |  -18.71% |  341.25 |  571.21 |  -40.26%  
Gross Profit (Rs Cr) |  450.34 |  468 |  -3.77% |  50.86 |  137 |  -62.85%  
Net Profit (Rs Cr) |  83.52 |  104.74 |  -20.26% |  -9.72 |  40.61 |  -123.93%  
EBITDA Margin (%) |  12.67% |  10.87% |  16.56% |  0.85% |  13.60% |  -93.75%  
ROE (%) |  10.70% |  14.83% |  -27.85% |  -1.18% |  5.49% |  -121.49%  
ROCE (%) |  12.59% |  15.47% |  -18.62% |  -1.10% |  8.80% |  -112.50%  
During the first quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25), the company sold 6.75 lakh quintals of sugar vis-à-vis 9.70 lakh quintals in the corresponding quarter of the previous year – that’s about three lakh quintals less. The primary reason was the early closure of the sugar season 2023-24, which resulted in lower sugarcane crushing activities in Q1.
However, the company was able to sell sugar at a higher price of Rs 3,833 per quintal in Q1 FY25 compared to Rs 3,608 in Q1 FY24. That’s a 6% increase in the current quarter.
The company sold about 123 lakh litres of industrial alcohol compared to 303 lakh litres year-on-year (YoY).
Sugar is sold only against releases. So, since releases were lower during FY24, sales were also lower. In the full year FY24, the company sold 27.52 lakh quintals versus 42 lakh quintals in the last year, which included exports of about 10 lakh quintals. This year there was a ban on exports.
For the full year, industrial alcohol sales were about 94,407 kilolitres compared to 84,175 kilolitres sold in the previous year. During FY24, only 20,944 kilolitres of industrial alcohol were made from sugarcane juice and syrup, compared to 46,203 kilolitres in the corresponding period last year. 
No capex is planned for the current year because the crushing numbers were low and due to the negative surprise from the ethanol policy.
Ethanol sales were low during the quarter. This was due to the restrictions imposed by the government on the use of B-heavy molasses and juice for producing ethanol.
In Q1, the net loss of Rs 9.72 crore was chiefly due to overheads not being able to be absorbed. Going forward, the company sees this issue being mitigated.
  * ### **Triveni Engineering**


Triveni Engineering, founded in 1932, is one of India’s largest sugar manufacturing companies. The company has seven state-of-the-art FSSC 22000-certified sugar mills strategically located in the sugarcane-rich belt of Uttar Pradesh. 
Triveni Engineering works with over 300,000 sugarcane farmers. A long and close relationship with these farmers has helped the company maintain its product quality and seamless value chain.
Triveni Engineering also operates in various other businesses, viz., engineering, power transmission, water and wastewater treatment solutions, and defence. 
Using molasses from sugar production, it produces ethanol and extra-neutral alcohol. According to reports, the company plans to divert 4.5 million tonnes of sugar towards the ethanol program, which amounts to almost 12% of its total sugar production. It also aims to increase its ethanol capacity from 660 kilolitres (kl) per day to 1,100 kl per day.
**Particulars** |  **FY24** |  **FY23** |  **Change (%)** |  **Q1 FY25** |  **Q1 FY24** |  **Change (%)**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Revenue (Rs Cr) |  6,151.40 |  6,310.10 |  -2.52% |  1300.65 |  1198 |  8.57%  
Gross Profit (Rs Cr) |  1,620.65 |  2,551.00 |  -36.47% |  301.46 |  349 |  -13.62%  
Net Profit (Rs Cr) |  395.2 |  1,791.80 |  -77.94% |  30.99 |  67.61 |  -54.16%  
EBITDA Margin (%) |  13.20% |  12.40% |  6.45% |  7.50% |  11.40% |  -34.21%  
ROE (%) |  14.21% |  78.83% |  -81.97% |  0.01% |  0.03% |  -66.67%  
ROCE (%) |  17.57% |  57.50% |  -69.44% |  0% |  0.00% |   
Net turnover recorded a rise of 8.6%due to a 12% higher turnover in sugar sales and a 5% increase in the sale price of the sweetener. Despite the higher contribution from sugar, profitability of the sugar business was lower on lower output and higher charges by way of off-season expenses.
The industry-wide ban on sugar exports and the prohibition on the use of sugarcane juice to manufacture ethanol negatively affected revenues and profits. 
During the quarter, the company did not export sugar. 
While the government had set a target of 15% ethanol blending with fossil fuels, the final figure was 13%. Though content with this figure for now, going forward, it hopes this number will rise to 20%.
An interesting development was the introduction of maize as a feedstock. Triveni experimented with maize and was successful. It now uses maize too, as a feedstock for the production of ethanol, which is then supplied to oil marketing companies (OMCs).
Despite weaker revenues, the profit before interest and taxes (PBIT) for the year improved to 29.4% Y-o-Y due to cost optimisation and savings in the various projects that were executed during the year.
The company does not propose to undertake any fresh capex.
  * ### **Balrampur Chini Mills Limited**


Headquartered in West Bengal and established in 1975, Balrampur Chini Mills Limited produces and distributes sugar, alcohol, ethanol, molasses, bagasse, and organic manure. The company operates power plants at the time of sugar production to fulfil its power needs and sells any excess bagasse in the market. 
It has 80,000 tonnes per day sugarcane crushing capacity, a distillery capacity of 1,050 kl per day (KLPD) and a saleable co-generation capacity of 175.7 megawatts. The company operates 24 facilities across 10 locations. It uses composting technology to create bio-composts under various brands like Paudh-Sakti, Jaiv-Shakti, and Devdoot.
**Particulars** |  **FY24** |  **FY23** |  **Change (%)** |  **Q1 FY25** |  **Q1 FY24** |  **Change (%)**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Gross Profit (Rs Cr) |  1,676.81 |  1,256.00 |  33.50% |  1045 |  1109 |  -5.77%  
Net Profit (Rs Cr) |  534.47 |  284.16 |  88.09% |  70 |  73.5 |  -4.76%  
EBITDA Margin (%) |  14.05% |  10.97% |  28.08% |  12.73% |  13.01% |  -2.15%  
ROE (%) |  17.04% |  10.03% |  69.89% |  2.06% |  2.54% |  -18.90%  
ROCE (%) |  20.82% |  10.44% |  99.43% |  4.10% |  4.80% |  -14.58%  
Q1 FY25 revenues and profit after tax (PAT) fell over 2% and 5%, respectively. The muted numbers were mostly due to regulatory issues surrounding its distillery operations. This resulted in lower ethanol production.
Sugar sales volumes and realisation grew by 3.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins of the distillery business rose by 96 bps y-o-y to 19.1%.
Sugarcane crushing was lower by about 54%, and sugar production fell by about 48%. This was due to lower sugarcane availability. This in turn negatively affected the distillery segment. Also, the fixed overheads could not be absorbed fully in this quarter owing to a lesser number of crushing days (season). Consolidated revenue was up 2.3% YoY to Rs 1,422 crore on a 3% growth in sugar volumes and a 5% growth in sugar realisations.
  * ### **EID-Parry (India)**


EID-Parry (India) Limited is engaged in the production of sugars, sanitisers, super grains, and nutraceuticals. Based in Chennai, it is part of the ₹57,000-crore Murugappa Group.

ROCE (%) |  23% |  43% |  -45.65% |  3.70% |  5.80% |  -36.21%  
During the quarter, YoY revenue was lower due to lower release, and no exports.
In the distillery operations, Q1 sales were about Rs. 3.9 crores litres, consisting of 1.73 crore extra neutral alcohol (ENA) and 2.17 crore litres of ethanol. YoY, sales were 3.43 crore litres, of which 1.2 crore litres were ENA and 2.23 crore litres of ethanol. The average price realisation was Rs 64.31 per litre compared to Rs 61.8 per litre in the previous year.
Going forward, policy changes in ethanol blending, exports, and MSP will set the tone for the company.
  * ### **Shree Renuka Sugars**


Shree Renuka Sugars is one of the biggest ethanol producers and sugar refiners in India. The company's green energy business includes producing ethanol for blending into petrol and generating electricity. It is one of the major contributors to the Indian government's ethanol blending program. The company operates eight modern sugar mills, some of which produce ethanol. 
The company has an ethanol production capacity of 1,250 kl per day. It is aiming to increase this capacity even further.

It also operates five coal-fired power plants, generating an extra 450 megawatts for the state grid.
Bajaj Hindusthan is a major player in the sugar industry in India. During the 2021-22 sugar season (October to September), the company accounted for a significant 12% of the sugar production in Uttar Pradesh. However, its debts have been a problem for a long time.
To resolve this issue, it had undergone two debt resolution plans. That still didn’t solve the issue and Bajaj Hindusthan owed banks about Rs 4,771 crore. Of this, a maximum of around Rs 1,192 crore was owed to SBI. The company was declared a non-performing asset (NPA), and SBI and other banks took the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). 
However, the NCLT allowed SBI to withdraw the petition when the management said it would pay the entire dues. In fact, banks would not have to take a haircut in this case.

## **Factors to Consider Before Investing in Ethanol Sector Stocks in India**
While you might find ethanol stocks appealing for investment, it is in your best interest to consider the influencing factors before making a decision. Some of these critical factors are as follows:
  * ### **Government Policies**


The Indian Government may offer subsidies and [tax](https://groww.in/p/tax) incentives to ethanol producers, influencing stock prices positively.
Policies like the National Biofuel Policy and the Ethanol Blending Program promote biofuel usage, encouraging investment in ethanol companies. You should check the ethanol blending targets set by the government in the past and for the future and see if these targets are being met.
  * ### **Demand for Ethanol in the Country**


While looking for ethanol stocks for investment, study in detail the demand for ethanol in the country and the potential for exports.
  * ### **Weather Conditions**


Ethanol production relies on crops like corn and sugarcane, which are sensitive to weather. Droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events can reduce crop yields, negatively affecting ethanol production and stock prices.
  * ### **Crude Oil Prices**


Ethanol is used as a fuel additive with petrol and diesel. When crude oil prices rise, ethanol becomes more attractive, potentially increasing the stock prices of companies in this sphere. Conversely, falling crude oil prices can lead to decreased demand for ethanol and lower stock prices.
  * ### **Ethanol Production Capacity**


The production capacity of ethanol companies is crucial. Higher production capacity allows companies to meet demand effectively, potentially boosting stock prices. Also, the technology used and efficiency levels in ethanol production are vital factors prospective investors should consider.
  * ### **Exchange Rates**


Ethanol producers may export their products, and fluctuations in exchange rates can impact revenue. A weaker local currency can make exports more competitive, increasing revenue and potentially elevating stock prices.
  * ### **Financial Performance**


You should carefully analyse the ethanol company's financial performance by examining its revenue, profit, cash flow trends, growth ratios, and debt levels over the recent years. When evaluating ethanol stocks, prioritise companies with robust financial statements.
  * ### **Supply Chain Reliability**


When considering investing in the best ethanol stocks, prioritise companies that have a consistent and reliable supply of raw materials like sugarcane and maize, besides infrastructure for manufacturing and sales. This helps reduce the risk of production disruptions and ensures smoother operations for the company.
  * ### **Competition**


Ethanol stocks compete for sales through auctions held by oil marketing companies (OMCs). Companies with better margins will have an advantage over their peers.
Also, look for companies that command a bigger market share, as their strengths would be greater than those of other smaller players.
  * ### **Entry Barriers**


Prospective investors should look at entry barriers for new entrants. The lower the entry barriers, the greater the competition, and vice versa.
Factors such as availability of raw materials, regulatory environment, capital requirements, availability of latest technology, and ready buyers are some of the factors that need to be looked at closely.
  * ### **Quality of Management**


It is important to study the management quality to be able to decide on investing. If the company is being led by a team of professional managers, that will give a lot of comfort for all investors – current and prospective. 
  * ### **Investor Confidence and Public Perception**


If the company has a track record of making profits and sharing it with the shareholders, a transparent management style, and not giving undue shocks to investors, the investing public would have a good view of the company. 
Thorough research and a balanced approach will help you make informed investment decisions in the ethanol sector. Seek professional advice if needed.
## **Should You Invest in Ethanol Stocks?**
Investing in ethanol stocks requires careful consideration. Factors like commodity prices, government policies, and competition from alternative fuel sources influence the ethanol sectors.
While there is potential for growth in this sector, regulatory changes, market dynamics, and technological advancements can impact their performance.
Before investing in ethanol stocks, it is crucial to undertake research and stay informed about industry developments and government policies. Make sure you regularly review your investment strategy to keep it aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
## **Summing Up**
The ethanol sector in India offers promising investment opportunities amidst the country's increasing focus on renewable energy sources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.
Before investing in the top ethanol stocks in India, it is crucial to understand the various factors that influence the market. Moreover, seeking advice from a financial expert who can help you select the best ethanol stocks for maximum return on investment will be a good idea.
