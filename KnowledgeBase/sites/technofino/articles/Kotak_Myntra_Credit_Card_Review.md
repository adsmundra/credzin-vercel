Kotak Myntra Credit card has been launched recently which makes it the first cobrand card of one of the biggest fashion e-commerce merchants in India.

Here’s a short review of its benefits!

You are eligible for welcome benefits if you complete a transaction of ₹500 or more within 30 days of card issuance. Here the joining fees is well compensated with the welcome voucher. Myntra voucher will be disbursed to the customer via Email/SMS within 30 days of the activation of the card which can be availed to enjoy a discount of Rs. 500 on your Myntra cart.

Since Myntra spends have no capping on the discount hence you can spend as much as you can per month if you keep the per transaction value below 10K whereas on preferred partners you need to spend 66K per month to maximize the category cashback.

Domestic Airport Lounge Access: 1 Complimentary Visit/Quarter using Visa Lounge Access Program/Rupay Network.

1% Fuel Surcharge Waiver across all petrol pumps on transactions of ₹500 – ₹3,000, exclusive of GST with a maximum surcharge waiver of ₹3500 in a membership year.

Kotak Myntra card is in direct competition withSBI Cashback,HDFC Millennia, Axis Flipkart andStandard Chartered Digismartsince all of them reward you handsomely when you shop on Myntra. If your needs are limited then there is no card which can beat Digismart since it offers a 20% instant discount else I would suggest you go for an SBI Cashback card since with that you won’t have to restrict yourself to just select merchants.

If your spends are huge on Myntra every month then also getting paid add-ons of Digismart makes much more sense.

But if you still want to get this card then better opt for the RuPay variant so that you can get an avenue to spend via UPI from this card and complete your quarterly milestone. When it comes to UPI this is the second best rewarding card currently in the market after HDFC Tata Neu Infinity which gives 1.5% on UPI spending.
