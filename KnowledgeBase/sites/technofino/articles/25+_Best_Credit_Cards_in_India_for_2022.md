So let’s enter into the mad-mad world of credit cards without further delay.

Entry-level credit cards are best suited foryoungsters who have recently started earningor forbeginners who are taking the plunge for the first timeinto the credit card world. I have selected a few credit cards with good reward rates at an unbelievably low fee range.The ideal range for such cards is

If most of your spending is at Amazon then this LTF card with Amazon Prime Membership is a no-brainer for every beginner.

The cherry on top is the ₹2000 Cleartrip voucher it offers as a milestone benefit for every 1 lac of spends limited to the first two lacs every year.

SBI is running an exciting welcome offer for credit card applications via referral. You will get an e-voucher worth ₹500 on spending min ₹500 within 30 days of card issuance.APPLY NOW!

It continues to be a flagship killer since its launch in 2020 and it beats many premium cards and comes in such a low fee range. The thing I love about this card is the transparency with which transaction-wise cashback is shown.

If most of your spending is at Flipkart then this card is currently being offered as an LTF card and with this offer, this is again a no-brainer for every beginner.

A cheaper fee alternative for bill payment compared to Axis Ace and becomes free at just ₹50K spends per year.

IDFC is offering all the cards currently at LTF pricing and reward rates are the same for all the cards. If you are an LTF cards collector then simply go for it as the IDFC Bank is currently in an evolving state so I am expecting loads of offers this year. But remember you will be able to exceed the 2% reward rate of Axis Ace only if you cross spends of  ₹40K.

IDFC First is currently running an exciting welcome offer for credit card applications via referral. You will get 2000 Reward points worth ₹500 on spending min ₹ 500 within 30 days of card issuance. So what is stopping you from applying for an LTF credit card with so many benefits?APPLY NOW!

How about getting loads of free food from Zomato? Then simply go for this card and enjoy its lucrative 10% rewards on birthday spending. Currently, the card is being rolled out for selected Zomato users that too on a totally unknown algorithm. Expecting it to be available to all soon.

Mid-Range credit cardsare best suited for spenders who are willing to divide their spends into multiple cards toaccelerate their overall reward rates. I have selected a few cards in this category which justify the fee paid for having them.The ideal range for such cards is

One of the hottest cards from the HDFC stable currently for all the millennials and it justifies that name correctly. It covers almost all of your spends area with a very good reward rate. Grab it if you are eligible for it without a second thought.

I would suggest this basic card to everyone who wants an AMEX in their wallet for occasional merchant and AMEX offers.

SBI Octane is ideal for users having fuel spends in the range of  ₹8K- ₹10K per month and gives an unbelievable 6.25% reward rate on fuel. It can also be swiped for dining and grocery spends for a decent 2.5% reward rate.

SBI is running an exciting welcome offer for credit card applications via referral. You will get an e-voucher worth ₹500 on spending min ₹500 within 30 days of card issuance.APPLY NOW!

Another LTF card from IDFC with added benefits of domestic airport lounge access, and railway lounge access. Makes sense only for spends above ₹40K per month as then only you will be able to exceed the 2% reward rate of the likes of Axis Ace/Indusind Cards.

IDFC First is currently running an exciting welcome offer for credit card applications via referral. You will get 2000 Reward points worth ₹500 on spending min ₹ 500 within 30 days of card issuance. So what is stopping you from applying for an LTF credit card with so many benefits?APPLY NOW!

Premium credit cardsare best suited for spenders who want agood reward rate with an iota of luxuryinto their lives. Such cards often give youtravel benefits, golf sessions, or shared complimentary access to International lounges. I have selected a few cards in this category also for decent spenders.The ideal range for such cards is

A wonderful offering from BOB for all those who spends online in that range. Its reward rate is one of the highest ever. The only drawback is the so-called premium but poor customer support that comes with it.

For HDFC Regalia keep your spends via HDFC Smartbuy for maximum benefits. The uniqueness of this card lies in the shared complimentary domestic as well as international lounge access across its add-on members via credit card and Priority Pass respectively.

A great card from Indusind which offers a standard reward rate of 2% on all spends on weekends and is LTF after paying the joining fee.

You can reap maximum benefits from Diners Privilege if you route your spends via HDFC Smartbuy. The uniqueness of this card lies in the shared complimentary domestic as well as international lounge access across its add-on members via credit card itself.

Another LTF card from IDFC with added benefits of international and domestic airport lounge access, railway lounge access, and complimentary spa. Makes sense only for spends above ₹40K per month as then only you will be able to exceed the 2% reward rate of the likes of Axis Ace/Indusind Cards.

IDFC First is currently running an exciting welcome offer for credit card applications via referral. You will get 2000 Reward points worth ₹500 on spending min  ₹ 500 within 30 days of card issuance. So what is stopping you from applying for an LTF credit card with so many benefits?APPLY NOW!

Another great card from Indusind and offers a standard reward rate of 2.5% on online shopping and is LTF after paying the joining fee.

Another wonderful card from Indusind and offers a decent reward rate on weekends and even on wallet loads. It is also an LTF with a one-time joining fee payment.

A no non-sense credit card from Standard Chartered which offers a flat 3.3% reward rate on all spending and can be converted into shopping vouchers.

I am separating these exclusive travel credit cards as they offer their unique benefits and are recommended for you only if you travel a lot.

It is one of the best cards for people who frequently travel by Indian Railways and it offers a pretty good reward rate for booking train tickets via IRCTC plus added benefits of railway lounge. Consider this card if you do a roundtrip more than twice a month at least.

Axis Vistara Infinite is only for people who travel business class and are living in a city with the Vistara network. It gives exceptional value when redeemed for flight tickets but if you are an economy person then the whole perspective changes for you and I would suggest you to look for SBI Vistara Prime then.Currently, there is anamazing offerrunning on this card in which you get fee reversal for doing spends. Kindly ignore the date in the offer link as the data on the website is outdated and the same offer has been extended till the 15th of January,2022.

A new offering from Kotak with a very poor reward rate. Only good at its current introductory price with the welcome voucher of double the joining fee so it makes no sense for next year’s renewal until they provide any good milestone benefits like Vistara.

SBI Vistara Prime is a very good credit card for Vistara flyers which offers premium economy ticket vouchers and CV points for the spends done. Currently, this card comes only on the MasterCard platform and hence onboarding is closed. I am also eyeing this card once the ban lifts up.

SBI is running an exciting welcome offer for credit card applications via referral. You will get an e-voucher worth ₹500 on spending min ₹500 within 30 days of card issuance.APPLY NOW!

One of the best travel credit cards in India which gives you complimentary Taj Vouchers every year as you hit the milestone so that you can holiday in style once every year on this card.

This is a unique offering from SBI and the only one of the two cards available for Air India and offers a good value if the sector you fly offers Air India flights. After the takeover by TATA, I am expecting better redemption options and some good additions to this card to make it more lucrative to hold.

Luxury credit cardshelp you supplement yourluxury lifestyleby giving youunlimited lounge access, partner memberships, unlimited golf sessions and a higher reward rate which when converted into travel benefits gives you exceptional value. Such cards only make sense for you if you value business class travel, and other hotel loyalty benefits and believe in the power of paid credit cards.

The ideal range for such cards is

The dream credit card for every card enthusiast in India due to its lucrative 10X benefits. What to say about this card! This card has everything in it!

This twin brother of HDFC Infinia can be your best friend till the bank is not offering you Infinia. Some people find this card more rewarding for their spending with milestone vouchers and the Diners 10x program but be ready for lower acceptance than Visa/MasterCard.

This card is purely a lifestyle card backed with outstanding AMEX support. This card offers you hotel memberships, concierge services, and other luxury services. It has been a roller coaster year for all of those who are having this card due to mind-blowing AMEX cashback offers on this card as travel had come to a halt due to COVID.

When it comes to credit cards there is a simple rule that what is the best card for me wouldn’t be the best card for you! So that’s why I have recommended some of the cards which I hold and I think could be of use to all of the readers here. You have to think about your spending patterns and for which redemption you will be able to get the maximum return from the same. Plus also keep in mind the welcome benefits, merchant offers, lounge access, and other linked benefits to your card to find your best match!

I also recommend you review your cards and update your portfolio after every 6 months after carefully comparing the new entrants in the market. For updates on new cards and offers subscribe to our mailing list to get timely updates.
