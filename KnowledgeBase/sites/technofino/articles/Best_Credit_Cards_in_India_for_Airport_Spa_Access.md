Airports in India have added spas as an additional facility for travellers who wish to pamper themselves while in transit or waiting for their flight. Airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, etc provide spa treatment services. Such spas are designed for short, refreshing bursts of activity and provide quick treatments like head and shoulder massage, foot massage, back massage, and so on. The passengers are also pampered in highly busy and at times antagonizing conditions of the airport through these services, resulting in very generous and positive changes in the travel experience.

Cardholders can choose one of the following 30-minute services:a. Foot Reflexologyb. Head or Shoulder Massagec. Upper Back Massage

Spas may have additional facilities that are paid for but offer longer-term therapies such as full-body massages, facials, and aromatherapy.

Only authorized cardholders have access to spa services, and they must present a valid air ticket or boarding pass for same-day or next-day travel at the entrance of participating lounges. To confirm credit card authorization, a small charge of INR 2 will be deducted to verify the card’s validity.

Currently, all the banking partners use DreamFolks services to provide this access and the partner spas are operational in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Jaipur, Indore, Cochin and Bhubaneshwar. The list is very dynamic hence I request you to check the latest list with your card issuer before heading to the airport in case you wish to avail this facility.

I recently availed this facility at Ode Spa, Terminal 2 of Mumbai Airport since I had a connecting flight to catch after a red-eye flight. I used my DreamFolks card which was issued withIDFC First Vistaraand luckily I had done the conditional spending to avail the complimentary spa access. After flashing my card at the reception I was asked to report after 30 minutes since the therapists were busy. I chose to opt for foot reflexology since I was experiencing pain in my foot.

The oil massage lasted exactly 30 minutes, and the therapist was highly professional, expertly targeting all the right pressure points. I drifted off to sleep by the end, and when I stood up, I noticed my pain was completely gone. The place had an incredibly calming vibe, thanks to its soothing ambience and gentle music. Overall I would love to enjoy these services again and again if I have enough time to spare at the airport.
