Groww Mutual Fund (formerly known as Indiabulls Mutual Fund) is set to launch Groww Banking & Financial Services Fund - an open ended equity scheme investing in banking and financial services related sectors. The NFO (New Fund Offer) opens on 17 January 2024 and closes on 31 January 2024.
The scheme aims to provide growth opportunities and capital appreciation by strategically investing in the dynamic landscape of the banking and financial services sector.
However, before knowing the scheme in detail, let’s first understand the potential of the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services & Insurance) sector so that you get a holistic idea of the sector you’re investing in. So, let’s dive in!
## **Banking & Financial Services Sector in a Nutshell**
## ![The Banking & Financial Services Sector in a nutshell](https://cms-resources.groww.in/uploads/image_4_1_88754c4abf.png)
## **Why Invest in BFSI?**
India's Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector is reaching new peaks every day! Many different factors have led to this growth. Some of them are:
  * New and upgraded digital payment methods have truly helped to transform the traditional financial system by improving the efficiency of transactions. 
  * Return on Equity (ROE) in the BFSI sector has witnessed significant growth, which usually means improved profitability.**
  * Sectors like the insurance and mutual fund industry are fairly untapped, which leaves room for future growth in the long run, isn’t it?
  * Low penetration of the insurance and mutual fund industry may potentially offer scope for growth
  * Fintech companies expected to form 15% of the total financial services market cap by 2026***
  * BFSI stocks are presently priced favourably*


*Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made regarding future performance. 
**The sectors referred herein should not be construed as recommendations, advice to buy, sell or in any manner transact in this sector and neither should it be considered as a Research report from GAML/GMF. The scheme may or may not have exposure in those sectors. The Fund Manager may or may not invest in the above scrips basis the Scheme investment strategy please read the SID to know in detail.

## **Portfolio Strategy of Groww Banking & Financial Services Fund**
The scheme aims to achieve consistent long-term returns by investing in equity and other related instruments in the BFSI and other related sectors/companies.
The **[Groww Banking& Financial Services Fund](https://groww.in/nfo/groww-banking-financial-services-fund-direct-growth)** has adopted the following investment strategies:
  * The scheme has a flexible approach, avoiding style or market cap bias. This is done to adapt to market changes and BFSI sub-sectors, with investments having a time horizon of around 5+ years.
  * The emphasis is on large and emerging financial services businesses, utilising both top-down and bottom-up approaches.
  * The predominant focus is on equity and equity-related securities in banking and financial services while also allowing up to 20% allocation to other sectors.
  * The strategy includes participation in IPOs, emerging sectors, and primary market offerings, alongside potential investments in debt or money market securities within defined limits.


Please read the SID (Scheme Information Document) to know about the scheme in detail.
## **Intended Portfolio Allocation**
Under normal circumstances, the scheme’s allocation should be as follows:
**Instruments** |  **Indicative Allocations (% of Total Assets)** |  **Risk Profile**  
---|---|---  
Equity and equity-related instruments of companies engaged in the financial services sector |  80% - 100% |  Very High  
Other equity & equity-related instruments |  0% - 20% |  Very High  
Debt and money market instruments |  0% - 20% |  Low to Medium  
Units of REITs & InvITs |  0% - 10% |  Very High  
*Please read the SID to know about the Scheme’s asset allocation in detail
The Scheme may also use various derivative and hedging products from time to time in a manner permitted by SEBI to reduce the risk of the portfolio as and when the fund manager is of the view that it is in the best interest of the unit holders. The exposure of the scheme to derivatives will be up to 50% of net assets.

## ![SMART Portfolio Construction Framework for BFSI](https://cms-resources.groww.in/uploads/image_5_1_1_8fa08abf75.png)
