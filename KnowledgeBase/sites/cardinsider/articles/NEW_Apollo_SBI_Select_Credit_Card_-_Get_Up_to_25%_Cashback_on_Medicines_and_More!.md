# NEW Apollo SBI Select Credit Card – Get Up to 25% Cashback on Medicines and More!
15 May, 2025  / By  [ Kartik Kanwar  ](https://cardinsider.com/author/kartik/ "View all posts by Kartik Kanwar") /  [2 Comments](https://cardinsider.com/blog/apollo-select-credit-card-launch-india/#comments)
Apollo Pharmacy is a well-known and trusted brand for purchasing medicine in India. It has just launched the new Apollo Select Credit Card in partnership with SBI Card. Previously, there was an [Apollo SBI Co-Branded Credit Card](https://cardinsider.com/sbi-card/apollo-sbi-credit-card/), which has now been discontinued. The new Apollo Select Credit Card will provide privileges and discounts on purchases made through Apollo Pharmacy and the Apollo 24/7 platform.
![SBI Launches New Co-Branded Apollo Select Credit Card](https://cd9941cc.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SBI-Launches-New-Co-Branded-Apollo-Select-Credit-Card.webp)
## Health Benefits, Savings, and More
![Health Benefits](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20628'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Here are the features of the all-new Apollo Select Credit Card.
  * 25% cashback on medicines with Apollo Pharmacy and Apollo 24/7.
  * This card is available on the RuPay and Mastercard networks. Those who opt for the RuPay variant shall get the extra advantage of making UPI spends with their credit card.
  * ₹1500 voucher as a welcome benefit for Apollo 24/7 or Apollo Pharmacy.
  * Free Annual [FITPASS PRO](http://fitpass.co.in) Membership
  * 24/7 access to Apollo doctors.
  * Enjoy a 1-year free Circle membership with 15% cashback on medicines, 20% cashback on lab tests, free delivery of medicines, an annual health checkup, and ₹1 lakh accident coverage.
  * Spend ₹50,000 within the first 90 days of card issuance and receive a free lab test worth ₹1,999.
  * Spend ₹6,00,000 in a year and get a Noise smartwatch valued at ₹7,999.
  * Benefit from 4 complimentary domestic lounge visits per year.
  * Receive a free Priority Pass worth ₹8,500.


## Bottom Line
As predicted before, Apollo Select Credit Card is priced at a joining and annual charge of ₹1,499. It has been launched in association with SBI Card, which is the second-largest credit card issuer in India. Many of us had been aware of this card since March 2025, since it was available for pre-application on the Apollo app.
![New Apollo SELECT Credit Card Launching Soon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20628'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
The new Select Credit Card offers a much higher reward rate and better medical benefits than the previous Apollo SBI Co-Branded Credit Card. Those who incur regular medical expenses, such as tests and medicines, will save more if they apply for this card. Although a detailed review of the card shall follow, at first glance, this card appears to be highly rewarding.
_This card would definitely benefit those who are keen on staying healthy while saving a buck. Share your views on this new launch by SBI Card and_[ _Apollo_](http://www.apollopharmacy.in) _in the comments._

Healthcare benefits are good, but are they only for Apollo services? It would be more useful if they covered more hospitals and clinics.
