Source: https://www.technofino.in/amex-membership-rewards-credit-card-review

American Express has finally started issuing cards since they were put under an embargo by the RBI. Their most sought entry-level but highly rewarding card is known as AMEX Membership Rewards Credit Card and the other one isAMEX Gold Charge. If used correctly, these cards can help you yield good reward rates whether you hold entry-level cards or premium ones. With the recently started referral program, you can further take advantage of the joining offers.

Let’s check out how we can maximize rewards on it!

Application through referral is a clear-cut winner due to the extra 4000 bonus points. Since everything else is the same then why lose the extra 4000 MR points? Check out the link for detailed referral benefits information.

If you face any problems in the application process you can contact me onTwitter.

You can choose to apply for any AMEX card from the link in the banner. To choose and apply a card of your choice simply click on theView All Cardsoption and select one. All the information for that particular card is readily available on the website.

The major value of AMEX cards lies in completing their monthly or yearly targets. MRCC even though devalued recently in 2021 is still the most popular card among AMEX enthusiasts because of the value that it offers in the form of bonus points. I will discuss the effective value of these bonus points later on in our most sought TechnoFino Maximum section.

AMEX has aRewards Multiplierportal just likeHDFC SmartBuyfrom where you can purchase gift vouchers or do affiliate shopping and get 2X the normal reward points.

There are the following redemption options for MRCC.

AMEX allows you to take a statement credit on eligible transactions or pay with points on select merchants while entering OTP for your transaction at a value of 25p/point. Most of the new AMEX cardholders use this redemption method but trust me there can’t be a method worst than this to use your MR Points. They are much more valuable than this so kindlyignorethese two options.

Another method to redeem your MR points. With this, you can purchase flights, prepaid hotels, car rentals, and more on AmexTravel. Again this gives you a value of 25p/MR point and is highlynot recommended.

AMEX further offers you a huge variety of instant vouchers against your MR points which have different values for different brands. In this section, there are certain brand vouchers like Amazon,TAJ, BigBasket, Croma, Flipkart etc. which give better value over others and are called Gold Collection vouchers from AMEX. To redeem the gold collection you need to redeem vouchers in multiple of 18,000 or 24,000 MR points.

Just for an idea, I have presented some values for the Gold Collection as Amazon andTajgive the highest and lowest monetary value per point. Also, keep in mind that AMEX vouchers can only be used to bookTajProperties at non-discounted rates. Amazon voucher option is good forcashback loverswhileTajorVistaravouchers are good for those who are into travelling.

Sometimes AMEX brings upHot Rewardson particular brand voucher redemption which may give a very tempting value. You just need to keep an eye on them.

Now, this is the hottest redemption option for MR points and if you can play well with this you can yield values of even greater than a rupee per point.

AMEX allows you to transfer points to 8 different airline partners and some of them are so unique that none of the Indian credit cards allows you to transfer points to them like Asia Miles. We have a curated list of all AMEX airline transfer partnershere. For booking award tickets using points, you can refer to thisposton the TechnoFino Community.

Now, this is the most sought redemption option since anyone with a Platinum or Gold status withMarriott Bonvoycan just extract a value of more than 1Re/MR point by transferring a 1:1 ratio with suite upgrades, breakfast and lounge access with complimentary drinks are an added plus. Since AMEX is the sole transfer partner to Marriott Bonvoy so many points minter use MR points only for transfer to Marriott. What remains to be seen is what value it will offer once Marriott Bonvoy goes full dynamic since January 2023.

Other than this you can transfer to Hilton Honors also but the value is not that great as compared to Marriott. We have curated a complete list of AMEX hotel transfer partnershere.

It takes about3-5 daysto transfer Amex MR Points to various loyalty programs so transfer them well in advance to use them.

Case 1:If you spend ₹1,500*4 (₹6,000) transactions per month then you get to earn 13440 MR points in a year and get a reward rate of 7.1% even if you redeem for Amazon Vouchers. But remember that you need to pay annual fees of ₹1,500 (discounted annual fees only on referral) in this case and reward rates decrease to 4.63%.

Case 2:If you spend ₹20,000 per month and also complete target 1 simultaneously whether by doing (₹1.5K X 4 times + 14K cumulatively or ₹5K X 4 times). Then you get to earn 28800 MR points in a year and get a reward rate of 4.60% even if you redeem for Amazon Vouchers. No renewal fee is applicable in this case.

So anyway you get to earn a good reward rate of a minimum of 4.63% which is huge for an entry-level credit card.Since AMEX charges zero fuel surcharge on HPCL pumps so you can fill fuel of 6K every month to complete your monthly milestone bonus points. Though you won’t get Regular MR points on this.

Case 3:The real earning potential of AMEX lies in itsRewards Multiplierwhere you get 2X reward points on MRCC and the reward rate increases by almost 60bps.

TechnoFino Tip:Always try to split your transactions in multiples of ₹1500 to reach your milestone faster.

AMEX has recently started serving the following Tier 2/3 cities as well

Agra, Ajmer, Allahabad, Ambala, Amritsar, Aurangabad, Chittoor, Dehradun, Goa, Guntur, Guwahati, Jodhpur, Kanpur, Kolhapur, Kozhikode, Kurnool, Madurai, Meerut, Patiala, Raipur, Rajkot, Ranchi, Thrissur, Trichy and Udaipur.

Application through referral is a clear-cut winner due to the extra 4000 bonus points. Since everything else is the same then why lose the extra 4000 MR points? Check out the link for detailed referral benefits information.

AMEX is one of those cards in which one redemption option can’t fit everyone. Some find solace in gold collection vouchers and others inMarriott Bonvoytransfer. Miles enthusiasts can extract value from airline transfers too. So there is something for every AMEX card holder. While redemption opportunities are a lot I wish AMEX would bring 3X and 5X offers from time to time just like in 2020 so that everyone can rack up some points fast!
