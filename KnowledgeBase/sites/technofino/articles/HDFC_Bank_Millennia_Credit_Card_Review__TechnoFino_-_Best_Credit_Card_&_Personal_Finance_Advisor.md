HDFC Bank recently re-launched HDFC Millennia which is its millennial offering in September 2021. Though the card was a good rewarding card earlier also but now this refresh makes it a very simple-to-understand card. Here’s everything you wish to know about the card.

## **Charges and Welcome Benefits**
Joining Fee| ₹1000 + GST  
---|---  
Welcome Benefit| 1000 Cash Points (Applicable only on payment of fees)  
Renewal Fee| ₹1000 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| None  
Renewal Fee Waiver| Spend ₹1L or more in a year.  
Keeping that aside, the joining/renewal fee waiver conditions are pretty good for a card of this range and have amazing benefits.
## **Reward Points Accrual**
Spends Area| Reward Rate| Maximum CashPoints Per Calendar Month  
---|---|---  
Spends on Amazon, BookMyShow, Cult.fit, Flipkart,Myntra, Sony LIV, Swiggy, Tata CLiQ, Uber & Zomato| 5 Cash Points per ₹100 spent| 1000 Cash Points  
All Other Spends| 1 Cash Point per ₹100 spent| 1000 Cash Points  
  * No minimum transaction amount is required for points accrual.
  * Only HDFC card gives points on **wallet loads**.
  * Points will be credited in the first week of the month for spending done in the last month.HDFC Bank has a dedicated portal named [HDFC SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/) with which we get some extra rewards and cashbacks. The strategy for maximizing gains via SmartBuy has been shared later in the article.

SmartBuy Benefits| Total Cashback| Maximum Cashback per Calendar Month  
---|---|---  
[HDFC SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/) Cashback| Upto 10 Cash Points per ₹100 spent|  ₹1000  
  * SmartBuy Cashback will be credited within **90 days from the end of the month** in which spending was done.


[HDFC SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/) supports merchants like MakeMy Trip, Apple Tresor, and likes. It also supports multiple partners for travel bookings.
**TechnoFino Tip**
Align your billing cycle of the HDFC Credit Cards as much as possible with the calendar month by asking the bank to shift your billing cycle date to the 2nd of every month to minimize the calculations related to the capping of CashPoints and SmartBuy cashback. HDFC doesn’t allow the first and last two days of the month as your billing cycle date.
## ****Milestone Benefits****
![](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-millennia-credit-card-review/)
₹1000 worth of gift vouchers on spends of ₹1,00,000 and above in each calendar quarter or you can generate airport lounge access if you wish to since now this card is not giving complimentary airport lounge access. I would suggest you opt for the gift voucher and hunt for other cards which provide complimentary airport lounge access.
For instance, if you spend more than Rs 1 lakh during the January to March quarter, HDFC Bank will send you an SMS indicating your eligibility for milestone benefits. Upon logging in, you will need to select either an airport lounge access voucher or a gift voucher. Most people are likely to choose the Rs 1000 gift voucher, as airport lounge access is available with other credit/debit cards.
If you opt for the airport lounge access voucher, you will receive a digital DreamFolks QR code via email. This code is valid for 90 days and can be used at the selected airport lounges depending on your card variant.
![](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-millennia-credit-card-review/)Quite a list of brands available for milestone vouchers.
## ****Reward Points Redemption****
Modes of Redemption| Value per Point| Redemption Charges  
---|---|---  
Cashback (Statement Credit)| ₹1| None  
Flights & Hotels Booking via Smartbuy| ₹0.30| ₹99 + GST  
Rewards Catalogue at the SmartBuy Rewards Portal| ₹0.30| ₹99 + GST  
As this is a cashback credit card as per HDFC Bank, the table above clearly shows the intention of HDFC Bank here is to make conditions favourable for a statement credit. It’s a win-win for users and why not! After all, hard cash is better than all other redemptions if you are not getting better value than cash.
![](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-millennia-credit-card-review/)Hassle-free cashback redemption using HDFC My Rewards Portal.
  * The minimum CashPoint balance required for redemption against the statement balance is**500 CashPoints**.
  * CashPoints are valid for 2 years from the date of accumulation.
  * For Flights and Hotels redemption, you can redeem up to a maximum of 50% of the booking value through Reward Points.


## ******Other Benefits******
### ****Fuel Surcharge** **Waiver****
1% fuel surcharge waiver at all fuel stations across India. (On minimum transaction of ₹400 & maximum transaction of ₹5,000. Maximum waiver of ₹250 per statement cycle).
### ******Insurance Coverage******
Zero lost card liability: In the unfortunate event of losing your HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card, on reporting it immediately to the 24-hour call centre, you have zero liability on any fraudulent transactions made on your Credit Card. 
HDFC Bank Customer Care Number **1860 267 6161**
## ********Eligibility********
The eligibility conditions are not that high and the bank is also a bit flexible on them. So if you have a good relationship with HDFC Bank and are a bit underqualified for the criteria still we would recommend you ask for a Millennia Credit Card and the bank may approve it.
![](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-millennia-credit-card-review/)The neat and clean minimalistic design of the HDFC Millennia Credit Card.
For SalariedIndian NationalAge: Min 21 yrs & Max 40 Yrs,Income: Gross Monthly Income> ₹35,000
For Self EmployedIndian NationalAge: Min 21 yrs & Max 40 Yrs, Income: ITR > ₹6.0 Lakhs per annum
Unofficially if you have an existing credit card with HDFC Bank having a 1L limit then you can ask for an upgrade.
## **********TechnoFino Recommends**********
Anyone who has been tracking this card can easily judge that the card has been quite simplified now. With the minimum transaction amount limit removed and points validity extended by a year, this card has become highly rewarding even for a normal user who doesn’t understand the complexities of the T&C and is not a high spender.
We highly recommend this card to every millennial out there looking to get a hand on a reward-worthy credit card but are not able to decide which card to choose from due to a plethora of options out there. This one card can meet your every need from shopping, dining, commuting, apparel, and all those other things. We also recommend everyone maintain and build a long relationship with HDFC Bank as it is one of the most rewarding banks in the Indian banking space.

It’s not a must-have limit but based on the general feedback of various readers. HDFC is highly unpredictable and I have seen users getting a Regalia on 80K limit as well.

Recharges made on amazon gave 5% cashback on my last month’s statement. I hope other such payments also should attract 5% cashback. In my opinion it’s worth trying.

You have to manually calculate all the points as HDFC is not giving transaction-wise breakup on cards variants lower than Regalia. I have aligned my billing cycle to the 2nd of every month so that all my transactions are inclined with calendar month and there is no headache of doing calculations from multiple statements. You can follow the same.

When do they credit RP ? After statement genration OR calender month end ?
The reason why I am asking is my first statement got generated on 22 Nov but I received RP on 3 December. And upon calculation I found that they gave the rewards for entire Nov month instead of the statement (generated on 22 Nov).

I got this LTF based on my credit history and credit score across several credit information companies.

Thanks for the detailed review. I believe the blog content needs to be updated for Amazon shopping via SmartBuy portal. Amazon is no longer available hence 6% cashback is not possible. Only Rs 5000 Amazon voucher option is available. This will help the reader to compare the benefits with other cards.
