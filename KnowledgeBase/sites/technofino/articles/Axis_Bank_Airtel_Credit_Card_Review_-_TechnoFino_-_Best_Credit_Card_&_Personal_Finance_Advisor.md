Axis Bank Airtel Credit Card is the latest offering of Axis Bank in collaboration with Airtel. Axis Bank is going all guns blazing with back-to-back new and decent product launches. Axis is already creating some noise among credit cardholders. This aggressive stance by Axis is good news for all the cardholders as the competition is only going to further increase from here. Let’s check out this card quickly in detail.

## Charges and Welcome Benefits
Joining Fees| ****₹500 + GST = ₹590****  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| Amazon Voucher worth ****₹500**** *  
Renewal Fees| ****₹500 + GST = ₹590****  
Renewal Benefits| None  
Annual Fee Waiver| **Spend ₹2,00,000** or more in a **year**. (Except Rental and Wallet Spends)  
***** Make the first transaction within the first 30 days of card issuance to be eligible for the voucher.
The joining fee is well compensated by a cash equivalent Amazon voucher. What needs to be seen is that will you be able to extract good value for next year out of it.
## Reward Accrual
![](https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-airtel-credit-card-review/)Spends Area| Reward Rate| Capping  
---|---|---  
Airtel Mobile, Broadband, WiFi and DTH Bill Payments via Airtel Thanks App| 25%| ₹250/Statement Cycle  
Utility Bill Payments on Airtel Thanks App| 10%| ₹250/Statement Cycle  
Preferred Merchants (Swiggy, Zomato and BigBasket)| 10%| ₹500/Statement Cycle  
Other Spends*| 1%| NIL  
  * ****** Currently preferred merchants are **Swiggy, Zomato and BigBasket**. Preferred merchants may change at any time without any intimation from the bank.
  * Cashback shall not be eligible for fuel, jewellery spends, EMI, wallet loads and rental payments
  * Education, Fuel, Wallets, Jewellery, Government Payments, Insurance, Rent, and Utility Bill payments outside the Airtel Thanks app.


## Reward Redemption
Just like other Axis cashback credit cards, the cashback will be given as statement credit 3 days prior to the next statement generation date without any request. Like if the statement date is 12th March, the cashback earned in the Feb month cycle (13th Jan-12th Feb) will be credited on 9th March.
## TechnoFino Maximum
To **max imize the benefits** of this card you will have to spend ₹1,000 per month on Airtel services like Mobile recharges, broadband, and DTH services to get ₹250 worth of cashback. Paying utility bills worth ₹2500 will get you another ₹250 cashback. Another spend of ₹5,000 per month on preferred merchants like Swiggy, Zomato, and BigBasket will yield ₹500 worth of cashback every month. The 1% standard reward rate for all other spending is also an added benefit but less as compared to better cash-back cards available.
## Other Benefits
### Lounge Access
Access Via – Credit CardConditional Complimentary Domestic Limit – 4 Visits/Year
Being a starter card it may allow you access to selected lounges only so don’t make it your primary lounge card. Also very recently Axis Bank has added a minimum spending condition to this card ie one has to spend ₹50,000 in the previous quarter to avail of complimentary lounge access in the current quarter.
### Fuel Surcharge Waiver
1% fuel surcharge waiver at all fuel stations across India. (On minimum transaction of ₹400 & maximum transaction of ₹4,000. Maximum waiver of ₹500 per statement cycle). GST charged on the surcharge will not be reversed.
### Axis Dining Delights
Indulge in delectable cuisines and enjoy up to 20% off at 4000+ partner restaurants in India. You can check the complete list [here](https://diningdelights.axisbank.com/ "here"). But as compared to Zomato Pro and Dineout Passport, this offer stands nowhere.
## Eligibility
These are the eligibility criteria as shown on the Axis Bank website for this card.
  * Age 18-65 years of age.
  * Stable Monthly Income
  * Salaried/Self-employed persons both can apply basis income documents.


Applications for this card are currently being accepted via the **Airtel Thanks** app also if you already have an Axis Bank credit card then you can simply call customer care and ask for a swap.
### Customer Care Details
Axis customer care representative can be reached at **18604195555 / 18605005555**.
## TechnoFino Recommends
In my honest opinion, this card has an **exceptionally good reward rate of 10%** with a comfortable capping for an average consumer. Still, I am leaving the recommendation part for this card at an open end and at the discretion of the user as the card is only for a very specific set of users.
This card is a **no-brainer for anyone with high exposure to Airtel products due to a whopping 25% reward rate even on prepaid recharges. With exceptional 10% reward rates on Swiggy, Zomato, and even Bigbasket this card can prove to be a great family card too**.
Before taking the plunge **also factor in the annual fees** if you will be spending only on the **top three categories** then you will **not** be able to **get a waiver** and if you put your **general spending from other highly rewarding cards on this card** then it will prove to be **counter-productive**. So do your maths properly!
Comparable cashback cards are [Axis Ace](https://www.technofino.in/axis-ace-credit-card-review/) and [HSBC Cashback](https://www.technofino.in/hsbc-cashback-credit-card-review/) which provide rewards in the same category as Axis Airtel.

If you spend 1200 on airtel recharge plus dth and 5000 on prefered merchant permonth and pay the annual fees the reward rate is 12%. Exceptional. Bill payments via axis ace (the real boss).

I am on Airtel Family postpaid plan of 999 which comes to around 1180 per month and i can save 280+ per month. All the annual fee will be recovered in initial 2 to 3 months and rest is all the benefit. Still am not counting other recharges and utility bills.

Hey there.. I have a small question. Axis card upgrades obtained on the basis of existing credit cards are reported as new credit card accounts in CIBIL or seeded in the existing account like ICICI. Thanks in advance.

getting technical error while trying to pay utilities payment in Airtel Thanks app using this airtel credit card other cards are going through, seems most of the things in Airtel App is just for name sake like it fetches the bill but there is no pay button. Seems getting 300 cashback for utility payments is going to be pain in the a**
