## Charges and Welcome Benefits
Joining Fees| ₹4999 + GST  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| 1) Get 1 Premium Economy ticket as an E-Gift Voucher on payment of the annual fee and a One-Class upgrade voucher*2) Club Vistara Silver Tier Annual Membership3) [EazyDiner Prime](https://www.technofino.in/eazydiner-prime-membership-review/) membership: complimentary for 3 months4) Enjoy BQ Prime subscription: complimentary for 3 months  
Renewal Fees| ₹4999 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| 1) Get 1 Premium Economy ticket as an E-Gift Voucher on payment of the renewal fee and a One-Class upgrade voucher*2) Club Vistara Silver Tier Annual Membership  
Renewal Fee Waiver| NA  
  * The e-Gift voucher will be sent via e-mail within 15 working days post payment of the Annual Fee
  * You will have to claim the voucher within six months of issuance post which will be auto-credited to your account
  * After claiming the voucher you get another 3 months to use them after which they will get expired
  * *This One-Class Upgrade Voucher is given exclusively by IDFC First Bank and is not a part of the Silver Tier Renewal benefits which you will get every year. These vouchers can only be used either for revenue flights or award flights booked using CV points only. So with this card, you get **two One-Class Upgrade Vouchers**.


With a premium economy ticket voucher being given on every renewal, I would say this card is absolutely free even if you don’t use it since you will be getting a renewal benefit which is at least 2X of the fee that you are paying. The perks offered on this card are too good at the given fee range.
## Reward Accrual
**Spends Area**| **Reward Rate**  
---|---  
All Spends| 6 CV Points/ ₹200*  
Fuel, Insurance, Utility, Rent & Wallet Load| 1 CV Points/ ₹200  
Dining Spends on Birthday| 10 CV Points/ ₹200  
  * *Earn 6 CV Points per ₹200 on spends up to ₹1 Lakh in each statement cycle after that earning is reduced to 4 CV points per ₹200 spent
  * No CV Points are awarded for EMI transactions and cash withdrawals


### Activation Bonus
You can get up to 6000 CV Points that is 2000 CV Points per month on a minimum spend of ₹30,000 per cycle in the 3 full billing cycles after the completion of the first cycle from card generation.
## Milestone Benefits
The earn rate of 6 CV points gives a decent value. But the real value of this card lies in its milestone benefits.
**Spending Amount**| **Milestone Reward**  
---|---  
₹1.5L|  1 Premium Economy Domestic Ticket  
₹3L|  1 Premium Economy Domestic Ticket  
₹4.5L|  1 Premium Economy Domestic Ticket  
₹9L|  1 Premium Economy Domestic Ticket  
₹12L|  1 Premium Economy Domestic Ticket  
![IDFC First Club Vistara](https://www.technofino.in/idfc-first-club-vistara-credit-card-review/)Menu card for Premium Economy fliers.
## TechnoFino Maximum
Since the 9 Lakh milestone sits almost at double the requirement so it doesn’t make any sense to go beyond **₹4.5L milestone**. Assuming you spend 50-50% on both categories you get to earn approximately
  * **8,000 CV points**
  * **4 Premium Economy tickets**


With 8K CV points, you can fly from Delhi to Bengaluru economy which approximately costs ₹5,000 for a revenue ticket. The 4 domestic flight vouchers are worth ₹10K each even if we are taken a conservative value like for the Delhi-Bengaluru flight.
The equivalent reward rate comes out to be a whopping **9%!** even if you factor in the taxes you will be paying for booking redemption tickets.

I hope now you can imagine the value that it gives to you. And you can also use these vouchers and points for your family and friends by adding them as a nominee in your Club Vistara Account.
## Other Benefits
### Vistara CV Silver Membership
One gets a complimentary [Club Vistara](https://www.technofino.in/club-vistara-the-ultimate-guide/) Silver Tier till you hold IDFC Club Vistara which offers you a host of benefits like priority boarding, priority check-in, 5 kg extra baggage allowance, and the like.

  * No fuel surcharge waiver is applicable on this card


### Forex Markup Charges

## TechnoFino Recommends
The cards which are direct competitors of this card are the [SBI Club Vistara Prime](https://www.technofino.in/sbi-club-vistara-prime-credit-card-review/) and the [Axis Vistara Signature](https://www.technofino.in/axis-vistara-signature-credit-card/). My general recommendations for the Vistara lineup of cards are the SBI Club Vistara Prime and [Axis Infinite](https://www.technofino.in/axis-vistara-infinite-credit-card-review/) so that you get the best of the Vistara with CV Gold.
So if you really travel a lot using Vistara Airlines then you can get this card and try reaching that ₹4.5L or even keep it just for that annual voucher benefit. If you don’t travel a lot and just want to get the best card then I would suggest you get the SBI Vistara one which provides you 4 PEY tickets and a Yatra Voucher worth ₹10K on crossing the ₹8L milestone.
I would rate this card equal to Axis Vistara Signature priced at ₹3000 although the earning rate of IDFC First Club Vistara is higher but spending to access the airport lounges that too for a paid card worth ₹4999 doesn’t make any sense. Also, keep in mind Axis does rewards spends on Insurance and Utilities. The only thing which makes it superior is that extra one-class upgrade voucher.

You have been little dishonest in your review of the IDFC Vistara card. You have not clearly mentioned the Fees of the competitor Axis and SBI cards. Those cards are same in benefits as IDFC Card but with Rs. 2000 less fee. In fact, SBI Vistara Prime is much better having Yatra voucher as an additional milestone benefit. Only the reward rate of IDFC Card is slightly better. But the fee is also 67% higher. Further, it has no unconditional lounge access which Axis and SBI cards have. You have also not mentioned why should anyone choose IDFC Card over competitor Axis and SBI cards which can justify a very high fee of Rs. 4999 Plus GST. Please don’t misrepresent benefits of products and conceal those of competitors to push one product over another. And also, please add a disclaimer in future if the review is a paid promotion.

it’ll be better to read the review first then comment. Everything you mentioned here is already mentioned in the article. And this is a review of IDFC First vistara card, not a comparison of SBI vistara prime and idfc first vistara.

I have read the article twice fully. I read all your articles carefully as I respect your views a lot. But it appears that the article is trying to position the IDFC Card above Axis and SBI Cards, which it is not. Therefore, as mentioned by you, you may also please write an article comparing the 3 cards for proper guidance and better decision making for the inexperienced.

Correction: Silver tier gives you 9 Club Vistara Points for every ₹100 that you spend on Vistara flights.
My thought: This card seems good in front of Axis Vistara Signature (atleast for first year) Assuming 4.5L annual spend on normal category, by paying 2500/- extra as Joining fees, we gets: 4500 extra CV points annually +3000 extra bonus CV points (joining benefits) +extra upgrade voucher

Axis has now stopped issuing cv points on insurance/rent spends + rental spends are also charged 1%+gst. With that change, I think IDFC Vistara becomes best in line if one’s spends are in these categories.
