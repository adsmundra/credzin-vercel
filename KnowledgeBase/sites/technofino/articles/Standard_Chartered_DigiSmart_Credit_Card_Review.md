# Standard Chartered DigiSmart Credit Card Review

Standard Chartered DigiSmart is a very interesting and unique card especially if you have high spending on its partner merchants. Since this card offers no reward whatsoever for spending done on any other merchant. Itâ€™s made for the millennials who love to shop, roam around and hang out on weekends at the nearest multiplex.

So letâ€™s have a quick look at what this card offers!

This card offers a monthly fee structure which is different from the usual annual fee structure. You get your fee reversed after 90 days of it being levied if you spend â‚¹5000 in the next month. Like if monthly fees have been charged in your January statement then you need to spend â‚¹5000 in February to get the same reversed in the month of April. Since itâ€™s very complicated and the amount is meagre so you may lose interest in tracking the reversals. I do see some reversals sometimes and donâ€™t bother about it more than this.

Rent Payment Surcharge â€“ 1% + GST.

From a fee point of view, Standard Chartered treats DigiSmart add-ons like a separate card though certain cashbacks have a common capping.

Also, I have seen some lucky people getting it converted to LTF pricing basis of theirStandard Chartered Ultimatecard relationship.

This is the most sought benefit of this card. Since this offer is not capped at card level so you can apply for supplementary cards and enjoy that huge no-condition attached discount multiple times a month. ðŸ˜‰

TechnoFino Tipâ€“Since you can use this card only once per month and fashion is that category in which there are frequent returns and replacements required so itâ€™s better to load â‚¹3,500 every month to your Myntra wallet and use it as you wish.

For travel benefits, the partner merchant isYatraand benefits on Domestic flights and hotels are quite lucrative.

Earlier I used to use the domestic flight offer quite a lot when ticket prices were low to get the maximum 20% benefit under that capping but now itâ€™s not possible anymore. Good card if you fly on shorter routes which have low airfare.

I donâ€™t think any card gives such a good reward rate on Ola Cabs. So if you take cabs once in a while then this can give you some really good value on that airport or railway station transfers.

Itâ€™s a very good offer if you regularly make those small-small grocery orders multiple times a month. Donâ€™t forget to apply the promo code since the same is mostly not listed on the app.

Needless to say, apply this only when you donâ€™t have any other offer at your disposal as the reward rate is too low for Zomato.

Itâ€™s a good offer if you are living in a lower-tier city since the movie tickets there are around that amount only.

This card is tailor-made for millennials who have considerable spending on its online partner merchants especially if you have just started earning your salary then this card is just for you. It gives you a good reward rate of up to 25% on many merchants which you canâ€™t get without holding a premium card. Even if you pay the full fee every month still you can get much more than the fee paid just by using the Myntra offer every month. And the rest of the benefits become a bonus.

And definitely, this is not meant for the people who are more into travel or are holding much more premium cards. But even for them, this can sometimes give more value.
