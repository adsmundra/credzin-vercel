Scams involving personal loans often cause the most monetary and mental damages. Families with pressing needs or individuals who experience difficulties to make a living are particularly susceptible on an emotional and mental level. They might become a target for con artists looking to profit.
You can avoid these scams by being aware of them. You don't want to become a victim of them.
How can you tell if a loan provider is real or fake? In this blog, we have mentioned a few pointers to help you identify possible Personal Loan Scams in India.
## 9 Ways to Spot Personal Loan Frauds in India
Here are the commonly committed loan scams in india-
### **1) Application Scam**
Application Scams may be the most typical kind of loan fraud. It happens when a prospective borrower gives false information about a payday loan. By providing misappropriated or misleading facts on their loan applications, borrowers try to deceive lenders in a variety of ways.
Here, the candidate may fraudulently steal someone else's identity to obtain a loan. The scam artist can easily escape with money if a solid KYC isn't in place, which includes PAN verification, voter ID verification, Aadhar number verification, and confirmation of other parameters.
The scammer may also misrepresent a victim's earnings or personal assets. False individual references or employers may also be fraudsters. These kinds of fraud generally include a helper who serves as the fraudster's reference or employer.
### **2) Demanding Up-Front Cash**
Money can be required at any time, and in a state of anxiety, individuals will do anything to obtain money.
On the contrary hand, fraudsters view this as a chance to engage in a personal loan scam or an online loan fraud case. Fake lending apps demand upfront fees with the promise of immediate disbursement of funds whether or not you have completed your application.
### **3) Guaranteed Loan Application**
Genuine reputable lenders declare upfront that they will need to check your credit. Most lenders want to know if you have a background in clearing your loans promptly and in full to ensure that you will be conscientious about debt repayment.
Deceitful businesses are unconcerned about your financial health. They are usually looking for high-risk borrowers many of whom are almost certain to not pay loans on time and face absurdly high late charges and fees.
### 4) No Disclosure of Charges and Costs
Examining the associated loan fees can help you identify a commercial loan scam and stop yourself from functioning on false loan approval messages. The fees related to the loan are never disclosed by con artists.
Even if you carefully browse their website, you won't discover any information on the costs and fees that they charge.
### 5) The Lender Doesn't Have a Physical Address
Each lender you are considering should offer a physical address. It's crucial to double-check this because some companies operating personal loan scams may mention locations that are already genuinely vacant homes.
If the lender doesn't appear to have a physical address, stay away from them. Numerous deceitful businesses are hard to find, which allows them to escape punishment.
### 6) Time Bound-Offers or Limited Period Schemes
Typically, a loan being offered to a client is a standing offer that lasts for a longer period of time than just a few days or hours.
There is a greater likelihood that the transaction is a [personal loan](https://groww.in/loans/personal-loan) scam when the loan provider or customer service representative clamps down upon you to pick and choose the loan within a specific time frame.
### 7) Spontaneous Communication
People in desperate need of money receive calls, emails, and texts from fraudulent lenders claiming to have loans available right away. Those very emails and messages may lead you to believe that you are guaranteed a loan without having to meet any requirements or have your credit score checked.
These lenders typically want to get your personal information. Kindly do not fall for their tricks.
### 8) It Appears to Be Unreal
A personal loan offer is likely to be false if it seems extremely attractive contrary to reality. Genuine lenders won't randomly call you and make you an alluring loan offer.
Without filling out an application and allowing a hard credit pull, you are unlikely to be approved for a loan with an absurdly low rate.
### 9) The Lender is Not Licenced in Your State
Authenticate the list of countries on the lender's website where it is permitted to do business. You might be having to contend with a loan scam if a lender you're engaged in does not identify registered states.
Verifying registration is an important step to take to make sure you're doing business with a legitimate brand and to distinguish scams from trustworthy companies.
