## **Sirca Paints Company Details**
Sirca Paints handles marketing and trading of paints and related products after repackaging the same. Sirca Paints gets the products from Sirca Spa Italy through import and sells them in the country through its distributors.
In addition, Sirca Paints also gets the products like thinners, abrasives and buffing cream from other suppliers based in the country. Except for the thinner and abrasives, which are bought from Indian suppliers, all other purchases are made from foreign countries and the products which are bought from Indian suppliers and sold out within the country itself.
Sirca Paints has entered into a Manufacturing License Agreement dated 16th February, 2018 with Sirca Spa Italy under the mark, “SIRCA”, for producing the following products that are presently distributed under the Product Distribution Agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company also has an exclusive right to manufacture the following products in India, under the mark, “SIRCA” – Paints NC, Paints AC, Thinner, Polyurethane Products.
The company in the territory of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh has a minimum sales of Four Million and three hundred thousand euros. The expect to achieve Four million and eight hundred thousand euros in the year 2018 -2019, respectively.
## **Financial Performace**
On the performance front, in the past four financial years, the company has generated a turnover/net profits of Rs. 54.08 crore / Rs. 1.97 crore in Financial Year’14, Rs. 69.77 crore / Rs. 6.18 crore in Financial Year’15, Rs. 72.66 crore / Rs. 7.28 crore in financial Year’16 and Rs. 84.34 crore / Rs. 13.70 crore inFinancial Year’17.
For the first nine months which ended on 31.12.17 of Financial Year’18, it has made a net profit of Rs. 14.60 crore on a turnover of Rs. 64.70 crore. In the past three financial years, it has incurred an average earning per share of Rs. 8.38 and an average return on net worth of 39.89 %.
It has also incurred a growth in the bottom line for the last four financial year’s which is astonishing, as it is mainly present in the trading business. The IPO is priced at a price/book value of 4.07 on the basis of an NAV of Rs. 39.31 as on 31st March, 2017.
If we annualize latest earnings and attribute it on a fully diluted post issue equity, then the asking price is at a price/earnings of around 15 against the industry average of around 41.30. However, its earnings for Financial Year’17 and nine months of Financial Year’18 is rather surprising and it may not sustain a forward go.It is also treading on a green -field project in a capital-intensive sector, which faces heavy competition and the consumer’s taste and preferances keep changing every now and then.
As per documents, it shows giants, Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac as its listed peers and it is trading at a price/earnings of about 56 and 53. As per market reports, these companies are selling products at much cheaper rates, which can be a problem for Sirca Paints .Thus, despite a good offer price, the IPO looks like a risky bet.

## IPO vs Mutual Funds
If you have no knowledge of the equity markets but are looking to gain from the equity markets, mutual funds are ideal. Investments can be made in Mutual Funds since they provide a wide variety and also, the amount of investment can vary as per investor’s preference.
Many mutual funds invest in IPOs and many times at discounted rates that are not available to retail investors.
It is necessary to not get carried away by the hype surrounding IPOs. One must not jump into IPO if he/she does not have the necessary skills.
In a mutual fund, a skilled and trained professional handles all investments for the investor and therefore, the investor can benefit from the equity markets without spending too much time gaining the skills needed to understand the markets.
**Following are the different funds:**
  * Large Cap Funds– The investment here is made in large-cap companies. These companies offer 12-18% return. Moderate risk is involved and it is suggested that an investor invests for 4 or more years.
  * Mid Cap Funds– Here the investment is made in mid-cap companies. These companies offer 15-20% return. Moderately high risk is involved and it is suggested to invest here for 5 or more years.
  * Small Cap Funds– Here the investment is made in small-cap companies. These companies offer 15-20% return. High risk is involved and it is suggested to invest here for 6 or more years.
  * Balanced Fund– This fund is a combination of equity and debt funds, in its portfolio. Depending on the proportion of investment made in Equity and Debt, the risk and returns are determined. It is suggested that one invests for 2 to 3 years. Returns in this fund range from 11-14%.


Investment can be made via lump sum investment or through SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) mode in any of these funds.
Moreover, return is something that cannot be promised but these return estimates are given on the basis of past performance.
## Mutual Funds for 2018
### Large Cap Fund:
These funds invest in large companies that have a history of good performance and stable balances.
  * [SBI Bluechip Fund](https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-bluechip-fund-growth)


### Mid Cap Fund:
These are funds that are high risk – high return. They’re a bit riskier than large-cap funds.
  * Example: [Aditya Birla Small & Midcap Fund](https://groww.in/mutual-funds/birla-sun-life-small-midcap-fund-growth)


### Small Cap Fund:
These are the funds that you can invest in, if you want high growth. They constitute a large magnitude of risk
