Active Decisions and Considerations
Documentation Approach: The Memory Bank is being structured to provide clear context about the project while avoiding duplication with existing documentation.

Component Boundaries: Special attention is being paid to the boundaries between components, particularly the Spring/Kotlin and Python parts of the application.

Development Workflow: Need to validate the described local development setup and ensure it's accurate and complete.

AI Model Integration: Understanding how different AI models are integrated and abstracted in the system.

Important Patterns and Preferences
Modular Architecture: The project is strongly modular, with clear separation of concerns across different components.

Polyglot Approach: Leveraging both Kotlin and Python for their respective strengths.

Testing Priority: Emphasis on robust testing, including specialized LLM evaluation.

Documentation in Code: Key components should have clear documentation, both in code and in additional resources.

Experimentation Workflow: There's a clear path from experimentation (in the experiment directory) to production code.
