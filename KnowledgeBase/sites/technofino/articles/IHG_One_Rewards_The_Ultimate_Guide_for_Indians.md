IHG, or the InterContinental Hotel Group, is a big name in the hotel business with over 6000 properties worldwide. The story of IHG goes way back to 1777 when William Brass first entered the hospitality industry with Brass Hotels. In 1946, Juan Trippe, the founder of Pan-American Airways, established InterContinental Hotels. Over time, new brands like Holiday Inn and later Holiday Inn Express were introduced. In 2003, the hotel chain went through a restructuring process and emerged as the IHG Hotel Group, boasting 19 different brands across the globe. Today, IHG continues its legacy, providing a wide range of accommodations to travellers everywhere. We have curated this Ultimate Guide on the IHG One Rewards for the Indian Travellers.

IHG Hotels has 20 different types of hotels to make all kinds of guests happy. From super fancy Six Senses to the budget-friendly Holiday Inn, they have something for everyone. Let’s look at each brand and its speciality:

The IHG One Rewards program offers different membership levels, each with its own set of benefits. Here’s a breakdown of the IHG One Rewards levels:

In addition to these tier levels, IHG offers its paid membership program called the Intercontinental Ambassador.

This paid program offers exclusive perks, particularly when staying at InterContinental hotels, enhancing the overall IHG experience for members.

Apart from the above, IHG also offers two exclusive, invite-only programs for their most dedicated customers, providing extraordinary perks beyond publicly available elite statuses:

These exclusive programs aim to provide top-tier members with exceptional benefits, ensuring a truly luxurious and personalized experience during their stays.

IHG provides both publicly advertised and undisclosed fast-track options for achieving Elite Status. Occasionally, IHG may present a Fast-track Elite Status promotion, allowing you to reach Elite Status with a reduced number of stays at their properties within a specified timeframe. It’s advisable to stay alert for such promotions, particularly around year-end, to expedite your status. You can find such offershere.

Another avenue to explore is theStatus Matcherwebsite, where individuals share their experiences attempting to match Elite Status from other loyalty programs with IHG’s Elite Status. These processes involve trial and error, and as of now, individuals have reported success with Hilton and Marriott Elite Status matches.

IHG One Rewards Milestone Rewards are special benefits you get each year based on how many nights you stay at IHG hotels. Starting at just 20 nights and going up to 100 nights, you get Milestone Rewards every 10 nights. All kinds of nights, including ones where you use your points, count.

Here’s what you get for reaching different milestones in a year:

These rewards make staying with IHG even more exciting and enjoyable!

IHG members have various ways to accumulate IHG One Rewards points, with hotel stays being the primary method. When staying at eligible IHG brand properties, members earn points based on the amount spent:

For elite status holders, the point-earning potential is even greater. In addition to the standard base points earned for each dollar spent at IHG, elite status brings additional bonuses, allowing members to earn up to 100% more points. Here are the elite status levels and their respective bonus rates:

Please do note that you can earn Reward Points for up to 9 rooms booked under your name but you’ll only earn Status Night for 1 room only.

IHG One Points can be earned through banking transfer partners, currently involving three available banking partners that permit the transfer of credit card points to the IHG One program:

Burgundy Private Account Holders can transfer Axis Reserve credit card Points at a 5:4 ratio, including all Edge Reward Points earning cards.

HDFC Infiniaand Diner Club Black Cards allow points to be transferred at a 1:1 ratio.

You have the opportunity to accumulate IHG One Reward points through the IHG Business Rewards program, which enables you to earn points when organizing various gatherings, including meetings and weddings, at select IHG properties.

To accrue points from meetings and events, it is essential to sign up on theIHG website. Once registered, you can earn 3 points per dollar spent when booking rooms, meetings, and events on behalf of others. Qualifying expenditures encompass:

It’s worth noting that some properties do not participate in the IHG Business Rewards program. A list of non-participating properties can be found on theIHG website. Additionally, there is typically a maximum cap of 60,000 points that can be earned for an individual meeting or event.

Every year, IHG One Rewards members have the option to purchase points, with a limit of 150,000 points annually. While these points can be gifted to friends or family at a fee, they still fall under the 2,50,000 yearly limit for individual accounts. Members are allowed to receive a maximum of 2,50,000 gift points each year. It’s important to note that purchases are handled by a third-party service called Points.com, meaning no travel category bonuses from credit card spending will be received.

Generally, buying IHG One Rewards points, or any points, is not a practice we often recommend, especially when not on sale. However, if you find yourself in need of boosting your point balance for an upcoming stay, purchasing points may be a viable option.

Before making a purchase, it’s essential to evaluate the value you’ll gain from the points. Additionally, IHG frequently runs promotions offering up to a 100% bonus on purchased points, making it advantageous to wait for such promotions to get a better deal. You can go and buy the points just by clickinghere.

In 2020, IHG, like many other hotel loyalty programs, abandoned its award charts and introduced a dynamic pricing model, aligning award rates with demand fluctuations, similar to cash rates. While the traditional concept of sweet spots has faded, opportunities for excellent deals still exist. Maximizing the value of your IHG One Rewards points requires flexibility, encouraging consideration of off-peak travel seasons.

When redeeming IHG One Rewards points, it’s advisable to compare cash and award pricing. A generally solid use of points is achieved when you get more than 50 Paisa per point.

For those facing budget constraints, IHG’s Points & Cash option offers a solution. This feature allows you to utilize a minimum of 5,000 points to offset room costs. To employ Points & Cash, conduct an award night search, ensuring “Rewards Nights” is selected under “Rate Preference”. Choose the desired property and select the “Points & Cash” option during the booking process, offering flexibility to tailor your choice based on your preferences.

If you have IHG One Rewards points and no upcoming stays planned, you can still extract value by transferring your points to an airline. Typically, IHG One Rewards points convert at a ratio of 5:1, meaning you get one airline mile for every five IHG One Rewards points transferred. The minimum transfer is 10,000 IHG Reward Points, and multiples of this amount are required for eligible airline partners.

Initiating the conversion of IHG One Rewards points to airline miles must be done via phone. Contact your regional IHG reward service centre based on your location. Keep in mind that it may take 14 to 21 days for the miles to be posted, so plan accordingly. Generally, this may not offer the best value for your points.

IHG’s airline transfer partners encompass a wide range, including Aeroflot Russian Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, United Airlines, and many others. This provides flexibility in choosing the airline program that suits your travel preferences. For the complete list of airline transfer partnersClick Here

Following recent updates in IHG Rewards, transferring points between family accounts now incurs a $5 fee for every 1,000 points. However, if you have an IHG Business Rewards account, which is available to regular IHG One Rewards members as well, also considering you’re a Diamond Elite member, you can enjoy fee-free transfers. It’s worth noting that there is a limit of 150,000 points for transfers to and from each account per calendar year.

IHG’s loyalty program offers ample chances to accrue IHG One Rewards points, which can be redeemed for reward nights. While the dynamic pricing model requires some effort to find optimal values, opportunities for significant benefits exist. IHG’s extensive global presence ensures that there’s likely a suitable IHG property worldwide, catering to diverse travel needs and points budgets.
