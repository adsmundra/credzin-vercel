The Axis Bank is out again with all guns blazing. It has recently launched two co-branded credit cards surprisingly in collaboration with SpiceJet namely SpiceJet Voyage and SpiceJet Voyage Black. Axis Bank and SpiceJet are a deadly combination as the customer service of both of them is poor.
The general buzz about this card is not that great due to another Axis Bank debacle of crediting lower cashback with their recently launched Axis Airtel Credit Card. Here is a detailed overview of both the cards with my recommendation at the end of the article.

## **Axis Bank SpiceJet Voyage Black Credit Card**
Voyage Black is the premium version of the twin SpiceJet cards.
![SpiceJet Voyage Black](https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-spicejet-voyage-credit-card-review/)Joining Fees| ₹2000 + GST  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| ₹4000 worth of SpiceJet flight voucher.  
Renewal Fees| ₹2000 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| 2000 SpiceClub Points ~ ₹1000  
  * Cardholders shall have to complete 2 transactions within 30 days of card approval to be eligible for the aforementioned e-voucher.
  * Cardholders will receive the voucher within 7 working days of meeting the eligibility criteria and will have a 1-year expiry.


The joining fee is well compensated with the welcome voucher but annual fees are not being justified by giving half the value worth of SpiceClub points.
### Reward Points Accrual/Redemption
Spends Area| Earning Rate| Reward Rate  
---|---|---  
SpiceJet Mobile Application & Website| 28 SpiceClub Points/₹200 Spends| 7%  
Online utility payments, Online food delivery, and Online entertainment| 12 SpiceClub Points/₹200 Spends| 3%  
All other spends*| 6 SpiceClub Points/₹200 Spends| 1.5%  
  * *Except fuel, wallet and EMI spending.
  * 1 SpiceClub Point = 50p for redemption.
  * SC Points earned for the purchases during the current billing cycle will be credited to the member’s SpiceClub account within 3 working days post the statement generation date.
  * There is a ₹1Lakh capping on spending done on SpiceJet portals to be eligible for points but I wonder who would be able to reach this threshold, especially for an airline like SpiceJet.


Reward rates are really very poor for general spending if you think from the view that they can only be redeemed for travel. Even if you are a frequent flier then booking a SpiceJet flight from an OTA will give you better rewards.
### Milestone Benefits
Spending Amount| Milestone Reward  
---|---  
₹2 Lakh| 4000 SpiceClub Points  
₹4 Lakh| 6000 SpiceClub Points  
The milestone benefit does jack up the rate nearly by 1% but even after that reward rate is too poor.
### Other Benefits
#### Complimentary SpiceClub Golden Tier Membership
Cardholder gets a complimentary SpiceClub Golden Tier Membership with a host of benefits.
  * YOU 1st priority check-in
  * 20% discount on meals & upgrades
  * Free Seat Selection
  * 2 SpiceMax Upgrade Vouchers
  * 2 Complimentary Meal Vouchers
  * 1 Free Change/Cancellation Voucher


#### Lounge Access
  * 2 Complimentary Visits/Quarter to Domestic Airport lounges.
  * No shared access for add-on cardholders.


#### Fuel Surcharge Waiver
A 1% fuel surcharge waiver of up to ₹400 per statement cycle, across all fuel stations in India. GST on fuel surcharge will be non-refundable.
### Eligibility
For Salaried Indian NationalAge: Min 18 years & Max 70 Years,No mention of income criteria on the Axis Bank website for this card.
## **Axis Bank**SpiceJet Voyage**** **Credit Card**
![](https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-spicejet-voyage-credit-card-review/) Joining Fees| ₹750 + GST  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| ₹1500 worth of SpiceJet flight voucher.  
Renewal Fees| ₹750 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| 1000 SpiceClub Points ~ ₹500  
  * Cardholders shall have to complete 2 transactions within 30 days of card approval to be eligible for the aforementioned e-voucher.
  * Cardholders will receive the voucher within 7 working days of meeting the eligibility criteria and will have a 1-year expiry.


Again for this card joining fee is well compensated but paying the annual fee makes no sense.
### Reward Points Accrual/Redemption
Spends Area| Earning Rate| Reward Rate  
---|---|---  
SpiceJet Mobile Application & Website| 18 SpiceClub Points/₹200 Spends| 4.5%  
Online utility payments, Online food delivery, and Online entertainment| 6 SpiceClub Points/₹200 Spends| 1.5%  
All other spends*| 3 SpiceClub Points/₹200 Spends| 0.75%  
  * *Except fuel, wallet and EMI spending.
  * 1 SpiceClub Point = 50p for redemption.
  * SC Points earned for the purchases during the current billing cycle will be credited to the member’s SpiceClub account within 3 working days post the statement generation date.
  * There is a ₹1Lakh capping on spending done on SpiceJet portals to be eligible for points for this card also.


Again a dismal reward rate across the spending areas and milestone benefits also make no sense.
### Milestone Benefits
Spending Amount| Milestone Reward  
---|---  
₹1 Lakh| 2000 SpiceClub Points  
₹2 Lakh| 3000 SpiceClub Points  
Even if you will be able to hit the milestone then also reward rate remains poor.
### Other Benefits
#### Complimentary SpiceClub Silver Tier Membership
  * YOU 1st priority check-in.
  * 20% discount on meals & upgrades.


#### Lounge Access
  * 1 Complimentary Visit/Quarter to Domestic Airport lounges.
  * No shared access for add-on cardholders.


#### Fuel Surcharge Waiver
1% fuel surcharge waiver of up to ₹400 per statement cycle, across all fuel stations in India. GST on fuel surcharge will be non-refundable.
### Eligibility
For Salaried Indian NationalAge: Min 18 years & Max 70 Years,No mention of income criteria on the Axis Bank website for this card.
## TechnoFino Recommends
The reward rates on both cards are too poor for any recommendations. Even for spending on SpiceJet, the reward rate is extremely poor. For online bill payments, food delivery, online entertainment and everything else I therefore recommend using a cashback card like [Axis Ace ](https://www.technofino.in/axis-ace-credit-card-review/)or Axis Flipkart and using the cashback earned to book tickets using OTAs which will give you added flexibility.
Every card issuer must apply a basic sense that you just can’t give a reward rate which is lower than cashback cards when redemption is limited only to flights. I mean it makes much more sense to get a flat cashback card than to get a lower reward rate and go for a fixed travel redemption. Vistara has done it much better with Axis Vistara Infinite and [SBI Vistara Prime](https://www.technofino.in/sbi-club-vistara-prime-credit-card-review/).
The second main factor in avoiding this card is the brand SpiceJet. The SpiceClub membership is not that value-driven as compared to Club Vistara Plus since there are no business class seats in SpiceJet hence you can’t get an upgrade and fly business. So all in all it’s not the card for anyone who flies business class domestically.
Plus the SpiceMax program is not up to the mark for the cost they ask for it. All you get is better legroom and first-row seats in the aircraft plus the discipline related to priority check-in and boarding is hardly observed by ground staff for SpiceMax customers. Indigo is much better when it comes to services, VFM and customer care. So these SpiceJet cards are a big no from my side.
