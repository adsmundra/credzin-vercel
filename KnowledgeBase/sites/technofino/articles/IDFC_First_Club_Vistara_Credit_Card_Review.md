Source: https://www.technofino.in/idfc-first-club-vistara-credit-card-review

IDFC First has recently launched an Air Vistara credit card which is drawing quite a lot of interest due to the value that Club Vistara provides when it comes to its loyalty program. After Axis Bank, SBI Card and IndusInd Bank this is the fourth co-branded partner for Vistara Airlines. Read on to know the benefits of this card, how to maximize them and compare it with the other cobranded offerings.

With a premium economy ticket voucher being given on every renewal, I would say this card is absolutely free even if you don’t use it since you will be getting a renewal benefit which is at least 2X of the fee that you are paying. The perks offered on this card are too good at the given fee range.

You can get up to 6000 CV Points that is 2000 CV Points per month on a minimum spend of ₹30,000 per cycle in the 3 full billing cycles after the completion of the first cycle from card generation.

The earn rate of 6 CV points gives a decent value. But the real value of this card lies in its milestone benefits.

Since the 9 Lakh milestone sits almost at double the requirement so it doesn’t make any sense to go beyond₹4.5L milestone. Assuming you spend 50-50% on both categories you get to earn approximately

With 8K CV points, you can fly from Delhi to Bengaluru economy which approximately costs ₹5,000 for a revenue ticket. The 4 domestic flight vouchers are worth ₹10K each even if we are taken a conservative value like for the Delhi-Bengaluru flight.

The equivalent reward rate comes out to be a whopping9%!even if you factor in the taxes you will be paying for booking redemption tickets.

I hope now you can imagine the value that it gives to you. And you can also use these vouchers and points for your family and friends by adding them as a nominee in your Club Vistara Account.

One gets a complimentaryClub VistaraSilver Tier till you hold IDFC Club Vistara which offers you a host of benefits like priority boarding, priority check-in, 5 kg extra baggage allowance, and the like. It also gives you 9 Club Vistara Points for every ₹100 that you spend on Vistara flights.

You are entitled to a One-Class Upgrade Voucher as a part of Silver Tier Renewal benefits which you will get every year and can only be used either for revenue flights or award flights booked using CV points only.

IDFC Club Vistara also gives a unique feature that gives youcancellation insurancein which you can cancel annually 2 hotel and flight bookings for any reason that too worth ₹10,000 when booked using this card. This concept is very interesting.

The cards which are direct competitors of this card are theSBI Club Vistara Primeand theAxis Vistara Signature. My general recommendations for the Vistara lineup of cards are the SBI Club Vistara Prime andAxis Infiniteso that you get the best of the Vistara with CV Gold.

So if you really travel a lot using Vistara Airlines then you can get this card and try reaching that ₹4.5L or even keep it just for that annual voucher benefit. If you don’t travel a lot and just want to get the best card then I would suggest you get the SBI Vistara one which provides you 4 PEY tickets and a Yatra Voucher worth ₹10K on crossing the ₹8L milestone.

I would rate this card equal to Axis Vistara Signature priced at ₹3000 although the earning rate of IDFC First Club Vistara is higher but spending to access the airport lounges that too for a paid card worth ₹4999 doesn’t make any sense. Also, keep in mind Axis does rewards spends on Insurance and Utilities. The only thing which makes it superior is that extra one-class upgrade voucher.
