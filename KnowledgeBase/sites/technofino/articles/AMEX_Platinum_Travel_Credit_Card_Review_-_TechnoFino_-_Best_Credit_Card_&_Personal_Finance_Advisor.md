AMEX Platinum Travel as the name suggests is a travel-based card for all AMEX enthusiasts. I would call this another no-brainer card from the AMEX stable. I have reviewed the other AMEX cards like [AMEX Gold Charge](https://www.technofino.in/amex-gold-charge-card-review/) and [AMEX MRCC](https://www.technofino.in/amex-membership-reward-credit-card-review/) here.
Let’s check out what is so tempting about this card!

#### Charges and Welcome Benefits
Joining Fees| **₹5,000+ GST**  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| **4000 MR Points on spending ₹5,000 within 90 days** + **10,000 MR Points on spending additional ₹10,000 within 90 days (Referral Cards)** Or10000 MR Points on spending ₹15,000 in the first 90 days (Paid Cards)  
Renewal Fees| **₹5,000+ GST**  
Renewal Benefits| NIL  
Renewal Fee Waiver| NA  
Add on Cards| 2 complimentary supplementary cards are provided.  
_AMEX doesn’t give you a spends-based fee waiver but you may get a waiver_ or a retention offer to keep you in the loop. Especially if you hold other AMEX cards then AMEX really values the overall relationship. Even then the rewards of this make up for the fee very easily.
Application through referral is a clear-cut winner due to the extra 4,000 referral points. Check out the link for detailed information on referral benefits. You can apply for any of the six AMEX Cards in India via this link.

####  Regular Reward Accrual
**Spends Area**| **Reward Rate**| **Capping**  
---|---|---  
All Spends*| 1 MR Points/ ₹50 spent| NA  
  * *Spends exclude insurance payments, Utilities and Fuel but are counted for milestone spends.
  * **Reward points never expire.**
  * You get to earn MR points even on **wallet loads**.


#### Milestone Benefits
**Spend Milestone**| **Regular MR Points**| **Bonus MR Points**  
---|---|---  
Spend ₹1.90L in a year| 3800| 15000  
Spend ₹4L in a year| 4200| 25000 + ₹10K [Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Voucher  
Cumulative Points| 8000| 40000 + ₹10K [Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Voucher  
  * You can get up to 48000 MR points on completing both milestones.


_**Technofino Tip** :_ Credit of AMEX points on completing the milestones is not automatic. After completion of the first milestone, you will get 7500 MR points automatically and the rest of the points will need to be requested from AMEX and the same goes for the 4L milestone.
#### AMEX Reward Multiplier
AMEX has a [Rewards Multiplier](https://www.technofino.in/amex-rewards-multiplier/) portal just like [HDFC SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/) from where you can purchase gift vouchers or do affiliate shopping and get 3X the usual reward points.
**Spends Area**| **Reward Rate**  
---|---  
[Rewards Multiplier](https://www.technofino.in/amex-rewards-multiplier/)| 3 MR Points/ ₹50 spent  
#### Reward Redemption
##### Statement Credit/ Pay with Points
AMEX allows you to take a statement credit on eligible transactions or pay with points on select merchants while entering OTP for your transaction at a value of 25p/point. Most of the new AMEX cardholders use this redemption method but trust me there can’t be a method worse than this to use your MR Points. They are much more valuable than this so kindly **ignore** these two options.
##### Travel With Points
Another method to redeem your MR points. With this, you can purchase flights, prepaid hotels, car rentals, and more on AmexTravel. Again this gives you a value of 25p/MR point and is highly **not recommended**.
##### Insta Vouchers
AMEX further offers you a huge variety of instant vouchers against your MR points which have different values for different brands.
**Voucher** **Brand**| **Value Per Point**  
---|---  
[Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Stays| 50p/MR Point  
Flipkart| 30p/MR Point  
Amazon Pay| 22p/MR Point  
Others| 25p/MR Point  
Clearly, this card is meant for travel only since MR points are better redeemed for Taj Stays Voucher or Marriott Transfer since that is where the value lies.
**_TechnoFino Tip:_** Since the MR points are credited into a common pool so if you hold either an AMEX MRCC or an AMEX Gold Charge then you can redeem them for AMEX Gold Collection Vouchers which will you a much better value.
Redeeming a 24K [Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Voucher will give you 58p/MR Point and Amazon Pay/ Flipkart Voucher will give you just 37p/ MR Point.
##### Transfer Points
Now, this is the hottest redemption option for MR points and if you can play well with this you can yield values of even greater than a rupee per point.
###### Airlines Transfer Partners
AMEX allows you to transfer points to 8 different airline partners and some of them are so unique that none of the Indian credit cards allows you to transfer points to them like Asia Miles. We have a curated list of all AMEX airline transfer partners **[here](https://www.technofino.in/community/threads/list-of-air-miles-credit-cards-in-india-and-its-transfer-partners.601/)**. For booking award tickets using points, you can refer to this **[post](https://www.technofino.in/community/threads/finding-booking-award-flights-beginners-guide.527/)** on the TechnoFino Community.
###### Hotel Transfer Partners
Now, this is the most sought redemption option since anyone with a Platinum or Gold status with [Marriott Bonvoy](https://www.technofino.in/marriott-bonvoy-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) can just extract a value of more than 1Re/MR point by transferring a 1:1 ratio with suite upgrades, Breakfast and lounge access with complimentary drinks are an added plus. Since AMEX is the sole transfer partner to [Marriott Bonvoy](https://www.technofino.in/marriott-bonvoy-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/), many points miners use MR points only for transfer to Marriott.
Other than this you can transfer to Hilton Honors also but the value is not that great as compared to Marriott. We have curated a complete list of AMEX hotel transfer partners [h](http://Thread 'List Of Hotel Loyalty Points Credit Cards In India 2022 And It's Transfer Partners' https://www.technofino.in/community/threads/list-of-hotel-loyalty-points-credit-cards-in-india-2022-and-its-transfer-partners.4943/)[ere](https://www.technofino.in/community/threads/list-of-hotel-loyalty-points-credit-cards-in-india-2022-and-its-transfer-partners.4943/).
_It takes about_** _0-5 days_** _to transfer Amex MR Points to various loyalty programs so transfer them well in advance to use them._
####  TechnoFino Maximum
This card is good for just ₹4L spent in a year and after that, the spending can be put on other cards.
**Spend Milestone**| **Regular MR Points**| **Bonus MR Points**  
---|---|---  
Spend ₹1.90L in a year| 3800| 15000  
Spend ₹4L in a year| 4200| 25000 + ₹10K [Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Voucher  
Cumulative Points| 8000| 40000 + ₹10K Taj Voucher  
On completing both the milestones you will have 48000 MR points in your kitty along with a [Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Voucher worth ₹10,000.
Now with a value of 50p/MR point when redeemed for travel one would get a ₹34,000 worth (including [TAJ](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) voucher) reward value on completing both milestones which converts to an **8.5% reward rate**. I mean what more can one ask for? If you are not into travelling and will redeem the points for Flipkart vouchers then the value drops to ₹24,400 and the reward rate comes out to be nearly **6.1%** which is also not bad in my opinion.
And if you hold any of the gold collection cards along with this card then with 58p/ MR Point value on a 24K [Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Voucher redemption you can easily earn up to a 9.5% reward rate. Even for cash-back lovers 18,000 worth of cash equivalent Amazon Pay vouchers along with a ₹10K [Taj](https://www.technofino.in/ihcl-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/) Voucher the reward rate translates into 7%!!!

#### TechnoFino Recommends
AMEX Platinum Travel is one of their best credit cards which provides an exceptional reward rate of 8.5% and is one of my go-to cards till I complete its milestone for the year. The only issue with AMEX cards is low acceptance but if you swipe your cards in premium places then there is nothing to stop you from clinching all of those milestones.

How do you calculate ₹34k value for 48k points and you say 0.5/MR point? Isnt it ₹24k for 48k points. Same with flipkart how do you get ₹26k? 48k points x 0.3/MR point = ₹14.4k

34K Value includes Taj Voucher also. I have slightly tweaked the Flipkart value. Thanks for pointing it out.

How do we request for that extra MR points after reaching the respective milestones? What do we exactly say to the Amex Customer Support for that 100% bonus points on top of the milestone benefit? Will they honour our request or purely at their discretion? Is there any nice way of asking so that our request won’t be turned down.. Thanks for the tip.. A very nicely written article…
“Technofino Tip: Credit of AMEX points on completing the milestones is not automatic. After completion of the first milestone, you will get 7500 MR points automatically and the rest of the points will need to be requested from AMEX and same goes for the 4L milestone.”

I think I got the answer I was looking for, It is there in the T&C/s Plat travel card as a last point..
* Membership Rewards points received on spend milestones is a combination of threshold Membership Rewards points and Bonus Membership Rewards points. You will get your threshold Membership Rewards points once you achieve the spend milestones however, to claim your Bonus Membership Rewards points, please dial the number mentioned at the back of your Card

A question on renewal fee: Do we get any MR points on paying the reweal fee of 5k+GST? Assuming we spent more than 4 lakhs in card memebership year, can we ask for annual fee waiver ( or atelast partial) or any any MR points? Do they generallly consider these kind of requests . Thanks in advance.

No official criteria but unofficially Spend 2L in 60 days and get an annual fee waiver Get an annual fee waiver in lieu of 10K MR points Pay an annual fee and get 15K MR points

No this card is useful only if you can spend 4L exact else the reward rate drops drastically.

Does a Amex Platinum Metal card whose yearly fees is close to 70k better than this card or you would rate this card as the best in the segment considering the MR points it is giving.

Hi Bhavye. I follow your blog and I am a big fan of yours. I got my amex platinum travel card yesterday and was thinking of applying for amex mrcc as well based on your recommendation of pooling the points and redeeming for 24 karat gold collection. When enquired at the call centre, to my surprise, the executive said that redemption catalogues of MRCC & Platinum travel are different and one can’t redeem platinum points for 24 karat gold collection. Please suggest.

Thanks for the detailed review Bhavye! Just a couple of queries:
1. Can the milestone points be redeemed for Air Miles as well? Since in your review and the official website, its only mentioned that the welcome/milestone reward points can be redeemed against Taj voucher (0.5/- per point) or Flipkart voucher (0.3/- per point)
2. Do you have redeemed points for AirMiles? If yes, can you share some details on the same that what exactly is an AirMile in terms of actual value in Rs. This option seems more flexible and lucrative but I cant find its proper details anywhere on the net.
3. I;’m a MRCC holder, and I talked to the customer service today only and he clearly mentioned that I wont be having access to gold collection with my new travel platinum card! :-/

The biggest issue with Amex Travel Platinum is 1) limited (2 per qtr) PP lounge access and NIL for international. Not truly a Travel card. HDFC Regalia or rather HDFC Infinia metal is so much better on PP lounge access. 2) online shopping with some premium brands doesnt accept Amex 3)getting an add-on for your partner especially if their address on KYC is not from top metro/T1 city gets declined even though the primary holder is you.
