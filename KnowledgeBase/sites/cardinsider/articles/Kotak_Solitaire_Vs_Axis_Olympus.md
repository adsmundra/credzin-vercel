# Kotak Solitaire Vs Axis Olympus
16 May, 2025  / By  [ Rose Chugh  ](https://cardinsider.com/author/rose/ "View all posts by Rose Chugh") /  [Leave a Comment](https://cardinsider.com/blog/kotak-solitaire-vs-axis-olympus/#respond)
Choosing the right premium credit card can be confusing, especially when you’re comparing two premium options like the [Axis Bank Olympus Credit Card](https://cardinsider.com/axis-bank/axis-bank-olympus-credit-card/) and the Kotak Solitaire Credit Card. Both cards are **designed for high-spending individuals** and offer great travel and lifestyle benefits, such as airport lounge access, hotel perks, and reward points. However, they differ a lot in terms of rewards and value-added services.
While the Axis Olympus comes with a high joining fee but offers excellent welcome benefits and luxury perks, the Kotak Solitaire keeps costs low, especially for existing Solitaire banking customers. If you’re someone who travels often and enjoys premium experiences, it’s important to know which card gives you better value for your money.
The Axis Olympus Credit Card comes with a high joining and renewal fee of ₹20,000 + GST, but it also offers valuable welcome benefits like **2,500 EDGE Miles** and hotel vouchers worth ₹10,000. In contrast, the [Kotak Solitaire Credit Card](https://cardinsider.com/kotak/solitaire-credit-card/) has no joining fee, and its ₹25,000 renewal fee is waived if you’re a Kotak Solitaire banking customer. However, it doesn’t offer any welcome gifts or spend-based waivers.

## Reward System Comparison
When comparing two credit cards, it becomes really important to consider their rewards system and evaluate them. Given the two cards, Kotak Solitaire and Axis Olympus, both with excellent reward structures, here is a detailed view.
The Kotak Solitaire Credit Card lets you earn **10 Air Miles for every ₹100 spent** on flight and hotel bookings through Kotak Unbox. For everyday purchases(base rate), you earn 3 Air Miles per ₹100 spent. When redeeming, **1 Air Mile equals ₹1** for flights, hotels, and travel add-ons on Kotak Unbox, while for other redemption options, 1 Air Mile is worth ₹0.5 for vouchers and merchandise.
With the Axis Olympus Credit Card, you earn **1 EDGE Mile for every ₹100 spen** t on domestic purchases and**2 EDGE Miles for every ₹100 spent internationally**. These EDGE Miles can be either transferred to partner airlines/hotels or can be used to book flights, hotels, and experiences with Travel EDGE. When transferring EDGE Miles to partner programs, **1 EDGE Mile = 4 Partner Points**.
When it comes to converting reward points to travel partners, Kotak Solitaire and Axis Olympus work very differently. Kotak gives you 10 Air Miles for every ₹100 spent on flight and hotel bookings, and most of these miles transfer to airlines like Air Canada at a 2:1 ratio, meaning 10 miles become five partner points. [Air India](https://www.airindia.com/) is an exception with a better 1:1 transfer rate, and Marriott transfers at 3:1.
On the other hand, **Axis Olympus may offer fewer points on domestic spends (1 EDGE Mile per ₹100), but those points are far more powerful**. Each EDGE Mile converts to 4 partner points, including airlines like Air Canada. This means even with lower earning rates, Axis often gives better overall value, especially for international travel or if you’re transferring to multiple partners.
## Other Lifestyle Perks
The two cards offer additional perks, such as lounge access and a low forex markup fee. The table below illustrates the benefits that come with both of these cards.
**Benefits Offered** | **Kotak Solitaire** | **Axis Olympus**  
---|---|---  
**Domestic Lounge Access** | Unlimited Domestic Airport Lounge Access for Primary and Add-on Cardholders & 2 Free Guest Visits in a Year | Unlimited Domestic Airport Lounge Access for Primary and Add-on Cardholders & 10 Free Guest Visits in a Year  
**International Lounge Access** | Unlimited International Airport Lounge Access for Primary and Add-on Cardholders & 2 Free Guest Visits Annually | Unlimited International Airport Lounge Access for Primary & Add-on Cardholders & 10 Free Guest Visits per Year  
**Airport Transfer Services** | N/A | 2 Free Airport Pickups and Transfers in a Year for Primary Cardholder  
**Movie Benefits** | N/A | BOGO Offer on Movie & Non-Movie Tickets Booked via BookMyShow  
**Dining Benefits** | N/A | 30% Off Up to ₹1,000 on Dining With Axis Dining Delights  
**Complimentary Memberships** | N/A | Complimentary Taj Epicure Membership  
**Foreign Currency Markup** | 0% | 1.8%  
**Complimentary Golf** | N/A | 8 Complimentary Golf Lessons/Rounds.  
**Axis Olympus clearly offers a broader range of premium lifestyle benefits** , including dining, movies, airport transfers, and golf. Kotak Solitaire shines mainly for forex transactions (0% markup) and travel perks like lounge access.

## Bottom Line
In conclusion, both the Axis Bank Olympus and Kotak Solitaire credit cards offer solid benefits. The Axis Olympus is ideal for those who don’t mind a high annual fee in exchange for premium perks like hotel vouchers, movie and dining offers, golf access, and strong international reward point conversions.
On the other hand, the Kotak Solitaire is a better fit for cost-conscious users, especially existing Solitaire banking customers, as it offers generous lounge access and 0% forex markup with no joining fee and a waived renewal fee. If you’re looking for a luxury-packed card with maximum lifestyle privileges, Axis Olympus delivers more value.
