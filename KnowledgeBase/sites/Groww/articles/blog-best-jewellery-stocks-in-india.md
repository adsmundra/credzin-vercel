##### ** _(The stocks mentioned in the blog are as per Analyst Ratings and Market Capitalization)_**
Diamonds and jewellery have long symbolised power, success and prestige, particularly for Indian women, providing not only social status but also economic security. Their importance cannot be overstated.
The gems and jewellery industry is one of the oldest and most vital sectors, playing a significant role in both the nation's economy and international trade. With its renowned expertise in jewellery craftsmanship, India has risen as a global centre for manufacturing, processing and exporting gems and jewellery.
## **Diamond and Jewellery Industry in India - A Brief Overview**
The gems and jewellery sector plays a big role in India's economy, making up about 7% of the country's GDP and 15% of its total exports. It also provides jobs for over 4.64 million people. The government sees this sector as crucial for boosting exports and has taken various steps to encourage investment, improve technology and enhance skills to promote Indian brands internationally.
India is a major player in diamond cutting and polishing. The government has supported the industry with favourable policies. According to the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), India exports about 75% of the world's polished diamonds, contributing significantly to the country's foreign exchange earnings.
The Indian government allows 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the sector, making it attractive for foreign investors. Recently, India signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in March 2022. This agreement will allow duty-free access to the UAE market for Indian gems and jewellery, aiming to triple exports to the UAE. The industry is expected to grow steadily at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.24% from 2023 to 2033.
