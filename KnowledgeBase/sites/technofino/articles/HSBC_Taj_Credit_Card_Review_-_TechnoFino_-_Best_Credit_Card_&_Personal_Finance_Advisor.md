## **TechnoFino Recommends**
The HSBC Taj Credit Card offers perks like a complimentary stay at Taj Palace, two stays at other Taj properties, 12 Taj lounge visits (tea and coffee only), and four spa sessions. However, these benefits fall short of justifying the steep annual fee of ₹1.10 lakh + GST.
The rewards structure is equally underwhelming, with a mere 1% return on regular spending and 3.33% on Taj hotel spending—disappointingly low for a premium lifestyle card. A more reasonable pricing would be ₹40,000-₹50,000 annually, coupled with at least a 2% reward rate on regular spending and 8% on Taj hotel spending.
Comparatively, cards like the Axis Atlas offer significantly better value, with up to 10% in air miles for hotel spending. Moreover, the Taj Chambers and Oberoi Belvedere memberships, touted as exclusive perks, lack substance. Their limited programming, lack of true exclusivity, and dwindling appeal render them almost useless. Alternatives like Quorum and Soho House provide far more robust offerings, including engaging events and genuine community value.
Ultimately, the HSBC Taj Credit Card struggles to deliver meaningful benefits or justify its high cost, making it a poor choice for most, even frequent Taj patrons.

Looking at such cards I have started thinking that the era of launching cards with Super heavy fees and Super Trivial benefits has started! I am not even sure how they arrive at pricing of such card at 110,000 + 18% GST! If I use a cashback card to pay this AF, I will get 3000-5000 cash back 🙂 Mostly, one would be better off with tata Neu Infinity to get some 5-10% neu coins on most of the stays on top of the 20-30% off on the Neu app.
