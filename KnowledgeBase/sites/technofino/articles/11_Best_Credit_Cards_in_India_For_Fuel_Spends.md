Here I am listing all the credit cards in India for fuel spending and will also recommend some of the cards as per a broad classification.

SBI is running an exciting welcome offer for credit card applications via referral. You will get an e-voucher worth ₹500 on spending min ₹500 within 30 days of card issuance.APPLY NOW!

There is a peculiar condition attached to fuel surcharges and their waiver every time you fill your vehicle. For every swipe equal to or less than ₹1000 a 1% surcharge is applicable subject to a minimum value of ₹10 per transaction but reversal is done only for the actual amount of fuel that you have purchased. So this isn’t a big deal for four-wheelers but for two-wheelers where the tank full value is usually below that number, it’s a bit disadvantageous. So keep this in mind while you are fuelling next time. I will also be recommending cards based on this in the recommendation section

Enroll inFuel Loyalty Programs in Indiaoffered by various Oil Manufacturing Companies to earn rewards in addition to the above credit card rewards.

If you are still confused about which one is the best for you. We will try to help you out but we can only broadly recommend some credit cards as the usage of every person is unique for fuel spending.

If you are holding an AMEX credit card then you purchase fuel usingAMEX MRCC/AMEX Gold Chargeand get benefits up to 5%-8% by redeeming them for 24K gold collection.

If you commute on atwo-wheelerthen mostly for a tank full the amount ₹400-₹500 and monthly spends are usually between ₹2000-₹3000 for an average user. So for such users, I highly recommendBOB HPCL Energieor Kotak IndianOil. The fee waiver condition on this card will also be easy to meet if used only for fuel.

Forcar ownerswith a very low consumption limited to₹3000 a month,BOB HPCL Energie or Kotak IndianOil makes a lot of sense due to its low annual fee waiver condition.

For consumers in the range of ₹3K- ₹6K a month I would again recommendBOB HPCL Energie.Also, Standard Chartered Super Value Titanium can be considered in this range which will give you the option to fuel at any OMC.

If your consumption isnearly ₹10K a monththenSBI Octaneis a no-brainer for you. And if you arecrossing even that limitthen you can club the spending with the recommendations given above with the SBI Octane Credit Card. With SBI’s generous sales offer and 2.5% reward rate on grocery and dining, you will easily cross the fee waiver threshold.
