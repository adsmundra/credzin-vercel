# AMEX Platinum Charge Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/amex-platinum-charge-card-review

AMEX Platinum Charge card is the second topmost credit card available in India from AMEX after the Centurion card which is an invite-only card. AMEX is known for its premium service globally and Platinum card is known for its high-end lifestyle and travel benefits. AMEX offers this card in metal form factor and with no pre-set spend limit (NPSL). This NPSL doesn’t mean that you can spend without any limits since there is an internal limit which is generally more than ₹10Lakh.

This card comes with a big joining and annual fees with an average reward rate on day-to-day spending. But still, this card has many takers due to the value attached especially if you have a high-end lifestyle. This card has been devalued now and then and has lost many tangible benefits.

Let’s check out its benefits in detail and whether they justify its fees or not!

The welcome benefits without any doubt equate to the high joining fees of this card since I value an MR point at around 50p.

Application through referral is a clear-cut winner due to the extra 10,000 MR points which you won’t get on applying directly. Check out the link for detailed referral benefits information.This link is valid only for applying the Platinum Charge card of AMEX.

If you face any problems in the application process or need any handholding related to credit cards you can contact me onTechnofino Communityif you apply via this link.

Other than this AMEX also gives targeted upgrade offers to current cardholders from time to time with more lucrative joining benefits like the recent one in which they were providing 135K MR points.

I have conservatively valued an MR point at a minimum of 50p although there are endless possibilities of using these points since AMEX is known for its travel benefits hence redeeming them for travel will yield you some good value. For the redemption part, you can check the reward redemption part of this review.

AMEX has aRewards Multiplierportal just likeHDFC SmartBuyfrom where you can purchase gift vouchers or do affiliate shopping and get 5X the usual reward points.

AMEX has another multiplier program which has recently been started and is applicable only on AMEX Centurion and AMEX Platinum Charge which are the top two cards available in India from AMEX. The rewards are simply unbelievable especially if you have a luxurious lifestyle and spend a lot on the listed merchants.

AMEX allows you to take a statement credit on eligible transactions or pay with points on select merchants while entering OTP for your transaction at a value of 25p/point. Most of the new AMEX cardholders use this redemption method but trust me there can’t be a method worse than this to use your MR Points. They are much more valuable than this so kindlyignorethese two options.

Another method to redeem your MR points. With this, you can purchase flights, prepaid hotels, car rentals, and more on AmexTravel. Again this gives you a value of 25p/MR point and is highlynot recommended.

AMEX further offers you a huge variety of instant vouchers against your MR points which have different values for different brands. In this section, there are certain brand vouchers like Amazon,TAJ, BigBasket, Croma, Flipkart etc. which give better value over others and are called Gold Collection vouchers from AMEX. To redeem the gold collection you need to redeem vouchers in multiple of 18,000 or 24,000 MR points.

One very important thing to keep in mind is that Platinum Cards are not eligible for Gold Collection redemptions hence to redeem points on Gold Collection you need to hold eitherAMEX MRCCorAMEX Gold Charge.

Just for an idea, I have presented some values for the Gold Collection as Amazon andTajgive the highest and lowest monetary value per point. Also, keep in mind that AMEX vouchers can only be used to bookTajProperties at non-discounted rates. Amazon voucher option is good forcashback loverswhileTajorVistaravouchers are good for those who are into travelling.

Sometimes AMEX brings upHot Rewardson particular brand voucher redemption which may give a very tempting value. You just need to keep an eye on them.

Now, this is the hottest redemption option for MR points and if you can play well with this you can yield values of even greater than a rupee per point.

AMEX allows you to transfer points to 8 different airline partners and some of them are so unique that none of the Indian credit cards allows you to transfer points to them like Asia Miles. We have a curated list of all AMEX airline transfer partnershere. For booking award tickets using points, you can refer to thisposton the TechnoFino Community.

Now, this is the most sought redemption option since anyone with a Platinum or Gold status withMarriott Bonvoycan extract a value of more than 1Re/MR point by transferring a 1:1 ratio with suite upgrades. Breakfast and lounge access with complimentary drinks are an added plus. Since AMEX is the sole transfer partner toMarriott Bonvoy, many points miners use MR points only for transfer to Marriott. What makes Marriott unique is that from Marriott you can further transfer your points to 40 other frequent flyer programs and travel all over the world!

Other than this you can transfer to Hilton Honors also but the value is not that great as compared to Marriott. We have curated a complete list of AMEX hotel transfer partnershere.

It takes about0-5 daysto transfer Amex MR Points to various loyalty programs so transfer them well in advance to use them.

Amex occasionally invites the cardmember+1 for a “complimentary meal” at ITC/Taj hotels located in metro cities or different high-end restaurants.

The Amex Platinum is not an ordinary card; it offers many lifestyle benefits. However, most Indian credit card users might find these benefits unnecessary unless they already pay for such perks. The card has a high annual fee that cannot be waived by spending a certain amount, and Amex doesn’t offer official renewal benefits. While you might get some retention benefits at renewal, recovering the annual fee after the first year can be challenging.

Decide if you need the lifestyle perks this card offers. If so, it’s one of the best credit cards available. If not, reconsider applying, as there are more rewarding cards at a lower cost. The Amex Platinum Charge is designed to enhance your lifestyle, not just for earning rewards.

Although the welcome benefit publically is limited to ₹60K TAJ Vouchers you may request 100K MR Points by calling the AMEX support line after receiving but before activating your card. They mostly approve such requests. Apply now to experience the AMEX Platinum Life!
