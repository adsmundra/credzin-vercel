Another straightforward credit card from Standard Chartered offers a flat cashback on online spending including wallet loads and Rent Payments.

TechnoFino Tip –  Apply for supplementary cards if you are regularly crossing the monthly cashback threshold.

The ultimate winner for all your rental payments and wallet loads!

Since the reward rate is highly dependent on the type of redemption a user is seeking so I am prioritizing this list basis the highest core reward rate of the cards irrespective of the redemption mode used.

We have excluded cards which are giving less than 2% reward rates since the majority of rental payment portals usually charge more than 1.5% as charges.

I have made a very specific list especially as the noose around the rental payments is getting tighter and tighter by the banks every month. Since rental payment is a significant expense for every household I recommend everyone to get a card from this list if they have a rental property, school fees, or maintenance charges to be paid every month.So if you are intointernational travel then Axis Magnuslooks best since then you will be able to complete the 1L monthly milestone by paying your monthly rent.Magnusworks even if you wantvouchersfrom your card or If you likedirect statement credits thenStandard Chartered Smartis the best option. Fordomestic travelAxis Vistara Infinite orSBI Vistara Primewould be an ideal choice if you can complete those milestones.With many people using it as a tool for credit rotation by doing fake rent payments, I can’t blame the banks for such moves. But instead of excluding rent payments completely from the reward structure the banks should partner with payment portals and allow genuine users to keep on earning rewards which can be a win-win situation for the banks too. I have prepared aRent Payment Guidehere which answers most of the related questions.
