SBI cards have recently launched three miles-focussed credit cards. The variants are namedSBI Miles,SBI Miles Primeand SBI Miles Elite which is the topmost version.

Here’s everything you wish to know about the Elite version of this card.

The welcome benefits are the same as the Axis Atlas, which now comes with 2500 Edge Miles and can be converted at 2:1 but with no spending condition. SBI should have given an incentive for renewal since paying such a hefty fee without any benefits makes no sense.

*Except for Fuel, Rental Payments, Utility, Insurance, Wallets and Education.

1% fuel surcharge waiver max up to ₹500 per month.

The card is poorly rewarding whether it’s the joining benefits, renewal benefits or the earning rate. There are many better travel-focussed cards available in the market. So I will be giving this card a pass. The only USP is the spending-based complimentary domestic lounge access to select lounges accessible only via PP which are now exclusive to cards likeHDFC Infinia, HDFC Diners Club Black and AMEX Platinum after the devaluation of Priority Passes ofAxis MagnusandAxis Reserve.
