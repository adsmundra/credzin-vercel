Bank Of Baroda Eterna Credit Card is the **flagship** offering from their credit card division known as **BOB Financial**. This card costs in line with other premium cards available in the market but gives a **super premium card reward rate**. This card comes on Visa Infinite and MasterCard World platforms.
I was holding a BOB Eazy Credit Card for the last 3 years and was a very early customer for them. I recently got my card upgraded to Eterna since I was using BOB cards a lot recently due to their mouthwatering online offers so that I could further sweeten the deal on all my online spending. Here’s a detailed review of this card.

We are also sharing with you an exclusive referral link for all** TechnoFino readers. If you think I have been able to add some value to your spending then as a token of gratitude you can go ahead by applying from our link. So what is stopping you from grabbing a BOB card?
#### Reward Points Accrual
Spends Area| Reward Rate| Capping  
---|---|---  
Online Spends / Travel / Dining / International| 15RP/ ₹100 (4X + 1X)| 5000 RP/ Month(4X)  
Selected MCCs| 1.5RP/ ₹100| None  
All Retail Spends| 3RP/ ₹100 (1X)| None  
  * *Reward program not applicable on Fuel, EMI transactions & Cash withdrawals.
  * Online Spends include **wallet** loads.
  * The capping of **5000 Reward Points exists on the 4X part of the total 5X reward points**.
  * Further spending on categories mentioned in the 1st column will earn you Reward Points at the regular earn rate of 1X.


#### Reward Points Redemption
Spends Area| Reward Rate  
---|---  
Online / Travel / Dining / International| 3.75%  
Selected MCCs| 0.375%  
All Other Retail Spends| 0.75%  
Fuel| 0%  
For special MCCs, we get lesser reward points including some high-spending categories like Rent, Insurance, Utilities, and Government Transactions. Earlier these transactions were yielding rewards at 3.75% but not from now onwards.
![](https://www.technofino.in/bank-of-baroda-eterna-credit-card-review/)Special MCCs List
  * 1 Reward Point = 25p when redeemed for statement cash.
  * Reward redemption charges are absolutely **zero**.


The card is great for **online spending, travel, and dining spending**. The reward rate in other categories is poor. The USP is that reward points can simply be redeemed as a statement credit for 25p per point that too without any redemption charges which is a great feature as most banks are nowadays charging for direct cash redemptions. And that 5000 Reward Point capping on the accelerated category is also very decent as compared to other BOB Cards.
#### Milestone Benefits
  * **10,000 Reward Points** on spending **₹50,000 within the first 60 days**.
  * **20,000 Reward Points** on spending **₹5,00,000 in a year**.
  * Bonus Reward points for Milestone Rewards will be posted to eligible cardholders’ credit card accounts within 30 days of the promotion end date.


#### TechnoFino Maximum
If you spend **₹41,700 (Online / Travel / Dining / International) per month** then you will cross the threshold of a maximum of **5000 of 4X reward points and get additional 1250 points at the rate of 1X and the total becomes 6250 Reward Points**. With this, you will be able to achieve the **yearly milestone of 5L spending and get another 20,000 Reward Points every year**. So now you have earned **95K reward points worth ₹23750 on spending just**₹** 5L** which makes the equivalent reward rate of a huge **4.75%** **CASHBACK**.
With the above, you also get to **waive your renewal fee** for the next year. I have not added the first-year milestone benefit in the above calculations.
#### Other Benefits
###### Lounge Access
  * **Domestic –** Unlimited access for both primary & add-on cardholders)Cardholders can get up to 3-lifetime free add-on cards for their spouse, parents, siblings, or kids. It’s disappointing to see no international access on this card but with the price point at which it comes and the kind of rewards, it gives I don’t have any complaints.


###### PayTM Movies Offer
  * Buy One Get One free movie ticket at Paytm movies up to ₹250/Month.


###### Golf Benefits
  * 4 complimentary rounds of green fees per calendar year (not more than 1 round in a single calendar month).
  * 12 complimentary golf lessons per calendar year (1 lesson per calendar month).
  * Discounted golf services at 50% of the green fee beyond complimentary sessions.
  * To Book Call- 1800-102-6263


###### Fuel Surcharge Waiver
1% fuel surcharge waiver at all fuel stations across India on transactions between ₹400 and ₹5,000
  * Max. surcharge waiver ₹250 per statement cycle.
  * No Reward Points are earned on fuel transactions.


###### Discounted Forex Markup

###### Insurance
  * Personal Accidental Death Cover:- Air: ₹1Cr; Non-Air: ₹10L.
  * Zero liability on lost card: Report the loss of the card immediately to ensure zero liability on any fraudulent transactions.


#### Eligibility

For a**paid variant above criteria are followed** internally by the bank and if you want it **LTF** then the bank is giving it **on an approval basis for ITR having income above ₹30LPA**. Unofficially existing card holders can **upgrade to a paid Bank Of Baroda Eterna** if they have a limit of ₹2L on their current BOB Card.
#### Customer Care Details
For feedback/suggestions/complaints/requests the customer can contact BOB Financial @ 1800-103-1006 / 1800-225-100 or write to crm@bobfinancial.com from your registered mail-id.
#### TechnoFino Recommends
BOB is very aggressive with its offers like 12-15% on flights/hotels via EaseMyTrip, Yatra.com, or even 5% cashback on bill payments via Amazon Pay. BOB is running a 5% cashback offer on utility bill payments for the last 2 years continuously on Amazon through which we can even book a gas cylinder at 5% off!! Even though it is a lending arm of a PSU Bank but is **phenomenally aggressive** when it comes to tie-ups with merchants.
Since the team involved is quite small so you may need a great amount of patience in dealing with their slow-to-respond customer care team.
And still, if you are not comfortable with the idea of keeping a premium paid card in your portfolio then I would **suggest** you go for any of its LTF cards like [BOB Premier](https://www.technofino.in/bank-of-baroda-select-credit-card-review/) or [BOB Select](https://www.technofino.in/bank-of-baroda-premier-credit-card-review/) so that you can **enjoy BOB’s online offers carefree**. So what is stopping you from applying for a **BOB credit card** with so many benefits?

Great review. I am holding this card for more than a year but for limit enhancement they are asking for ITR. Is there any way to increase limit without ITR ?

Hi Bhavye, once again very nice and helpful article. I want to check on the utility bill payments offer on Amazon. Is this offer applicable on all days? What are the categories that are considered under this?
Also, it would be worth mentioning that BoB card support isn’t that good. So some users might get delayed responses.

Yes, it’s valid on all days. The reward is applicable on your Mobile Prepaid, DTH Recharge, Electricity, Mobile Postpaid, Piped Gas, LPG, Broadband/Landline, or Water Bill.

All these are due to initial marketing gimmicks. Once they get their targets, these will slowly disappear

Yes, true. So use it till it lasts! Of course, there is the effort of applying, using correctly to take maximum benefit and ensuring all repayments are done on time.

Got the card approval sms after 53 days of applying. Now wait for card to come. Extremely slow process and the card has been devalued in the meanwhile. Strange. Will explore closing after one year

I am not receiving e-Sign link for Aadhar OTP on my mobile or e-mail. Its been more than 15 days since I applied and raised a ticket. The customer support is the worst i ever experienced. They keep on telling the same thing that they have escalated the matter but offer no resolution at all. Its total waste of applying for BOB cards.
Generally, what is the time taken by the team to process the application and send the agent for KYC verification and final approval??
