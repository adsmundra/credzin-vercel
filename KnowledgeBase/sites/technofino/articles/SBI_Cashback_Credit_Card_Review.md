# SBI Cashback Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/sbi-cashback-credit-card-review

SBI Cashback â€“ an insanely rewarding and unbelievably simple no-nonsense credit card that has taken all credit card users by storm. After Axis, it seems like SBI Cards has taken the lead to bring good days for all the plastic money enthusiasts. No one would have ever believed that one day some bank would offer products better than HDFC Bank in the market. From here the competition is only going to get fiercer for the banks and better for consumers.

So letâ€™s have a quick look at what this card offers!

Currently, this card is being offered at absolutely zero joining fees with no welcome benefits. The annual fee waiver condition is also not too high keeping in mind that the full threshold of â‚¹2L will give you accelerated rewards when spending is done online. This card is so simple to understand and use that you simply donâ€™t need to remember anything while using it.

Surprised? So am I!Straightforward 5% cashback credited to your statement without any redemption charges with an insanely high monthly capping.What more do you expect from a card? Letâ€™s see how long can SBI sustain it.

So make hay till the sun shines!

Spend â‚¹1L per month online to reach the huge threshold of â‚¹5,000 per billing cycle! As simple as that but wonâ€™t be easy to touch month on month.

1% Fuel Surcharge Waiver across all petrol pumps on transactions of â‚¹500 â€“ â‚¹3,000, exclusive of GST with a maximum surcharge waiver of â‚¹100 per statement cycle per credit card account.

This card is a delight for cashback lovers and I highly recommend it! All those who are worried about its fee should think that to break even you need to spendjust â‚¹23,600 in a yearand above that, all the cashback is nothing but your net gain if you donâ€™t cross theâ‚¹2L mark!

Still, SBI Cashback canreplace all the cashback cardslikeICICI Amazon Pay,RBL Zomato Edition,Â andStandard Chartered Smartand even beatsStandard Chartered Ultimatehandsomely if you are aÂ heavyonline-only spender and hardly use cards offline.And if you get this one then why even keep paid cards like Axis Flipkart andHDFC Millenniain your portfolio?

This card also gives a serious run for money toBOB Eternawhich is offered for a hefty fee ofâ‚¹2500 + GSTbut be mindful that Eterna rewards wallet loads. So I would not recommend weeding out all the winning cards from your portfolio in haste since the reward rate of this card is not sustainable in the long run so replace only what you are confident of getting back in case a devaluation happens.

Initially, this card was grabbed by everyone with a lot of enthusiasm which has now fizzed out since SBI has announced that this card will not work in online sales where SBI cards are already running an instant discount offer. So keep this in mind before replacing this with the above cards from your portfolio.

Though this card doesnâ€™t give accelerated rewards onUtility Bill PaymentslikeAxis Acebut then you always have the option of routing those spend through any online platform which can help you mask the merchant. ðŸ˜‰
