Standard Chartered Bank Smart Credit Card, is a new decent entry-level cashback card with attractive interest rates on EMI conversion. The credit card portfolio of Standard Chartered has lacked a punch for a long now due to its lacklustre offerings. But with this new launch looks like things are changing for good for users and becoming competitive for the bank.

Let’s check out what this card offers and where it stands out as compared to its peers!

*Standard Chartered is offering anextended interest-free period for the first 90 days post credit card issuanceby paying only the minimum amount due as awelcome benefit.

Unlike Axis Ace in this card, the cashback redemption is not automated and needs to be done from theR360 Rewards Portalof the bank.

To maximisebenefits on this card you will have to spend₹50,000 per month onlinefor amaximum of 1000 worth of cashbackand₹50,000 per month offlinefor amaximum of ₹500 worth of cashback. This card is good forwallet loadsas Axis Ace is not giving any reward points on the same.

Standard Chartered has made a good start with Smart but it is nowhere near the current hot cardthat is Axis Ace. With no lounge access, fuel surcharge waiver, and no welcome benefits in lieu of the joining fees paidthis card stands a bit below the competition. The only factor which gives it a punch is that itrewards you on wallet loading.

For someone who is regularlyloading walletsusing credit cards then you can go forIndusind cardsby paying one-time joining fees which can give thesame reward rate of 2% on weekendswithout any fuss of annual fees. With the restrictions getting tight on wallet loads I don’t think you will be able tomanage ₹10K wallet loading every monthto make it free for next year so having ano-frills credit cardmakes a lot of sense.

So if you are already holdingIndusind Iconia Amex or Indusind Legendthen you can conveniently ignore this card or you can apply for them instead of this card. Even if you haveIDFC First Credit Cardswith you then also you are doing good without it.Further, if you arealready holding Axis Acethen this card shouldnotbe on your wishlist due to comparativelylower offline cashback rates. I would recommend this card to all those who are not able to get their hands on Axis Ace. Also, StanC is not a pioneer when it comes to online sales and other promotional offers and you won’t be able to extract much value out of it on other online spending.
