Indian equity benchmarks mounted a modest comeback from initial losses to close almost flat today , as global macroeconomic restraint and geopolitical tensions dulled investor sentiment. The BSE Sensex fell by 82.79 points or (0.10%) closing at 81,361.87, while the Nifty50 fell by 18.80 points or (0.08%) closing at 24,793.25.
## **Global Weakness, Fed Outlook Weigh**
Markets began on a note of caution, echoing weak global leads in the wake of renewed worries about the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy path. Hawkish remarks by Fed officials stifled expectations of near-term rate cuts, leading to subdued risk sentiment on global equities. US markets witnessed moderate losses overnight as investors remained uncertain on inflation dynamics and rate direction.
In Asia, it was a mixed bag. Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite fell, but the Nikkei 225 rose. European shares opened flat for the most part, reflecting the wait-and-watch attitude.
## **Sectoral Trends: Auto and Energy Outperform, Midcaps Correct**
On the sectoral side, the Nifty Auto index was one of the ONLY gainers, up by 0.52%, on the back of shares of Hero MotoCorp is up by 0.30%, TVS Motor is gain by 0.16 %, and Maruti Suzuki is also up by 0.27%, which rose on hopes of strong monthly sales and declining commodity prices. The Nifty Oil & Gas index slipped 0.64% but found some support from ONGC, Indian Oil, and GAIL, as crude prices remained firm amid the geopolitical risk premium driven by ongoing unrest in the Middle East.
Mid- and small-cap stocks, though, witnessed significant selling pressure. Nifty Midcap 100 closed declining 1.63%, while the Nifty Smallcap250 index lost 1.93%.
## **Key Movers**
**Hero MotoCorp** rallied more than 0.30% following better wholesale volumes and optimistic outlook for rural demand.
**ONGC** rose more than 0.26% following firm global crude oil prices.
Bajaj Finance declined by 2.29%, Titan company fell by 0.93%, and Adani Ports slipped 2.52%, emerging as the top drags on the Nifty index.In the wider market, Suzlon Energy fell by 2.58%, RVNL declined 4.11%, and Mazagon Dock slipped 1.29%, as investors booked profits following their recent run-up.
## **Macro and Geopolitical Overhang**
Investor Worries also emerged from sustained geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, specifically between Israel and Iran, that have raised crude prices and reignited inflation fears. In the domestic market, investors are also preparing for the June series F&O expiry and looking for guidance from monsoon developments, which could impact inflation and rural demand dynamics.
Meanwhile, the rupee remained in a tight band, closing weak by a fraction at about ₹85.61 per US dollar, underlining global dollar strength and risk-averse foreign flows.
## **Outlook**
Analysts are cautious ahead of important domestic and international events, with a bias towards stock-specific action rather than directional index movement. The robustness of auto and energy counters during global headwinds provided some buffer, but ongoing volatility in mid- and small-caps signals caution among traders.
With the US Fed's path, monsoon advancement, and crude oil trends likely to stay in the limelight, Indian equities are likely to keep moving in a specific range in the immediate future, with phases of volatility around key data releases and expiry events.
Global equities have remained under pressure by mid-session, with losses persisting across Asia and Europe amid deepening geopolitical uncertainty. Investors are retreating to safe-haven assets, pushing gold higher traded at $3,371.15, up approximately 0.1%, reflecting and uplifting the U.S. dollar index firmed to 86.5650, rising 0.07% on the session and Japanese yen briefly touched 145.18, up around 0.02% as traders rotated into defensive currencies. Brent crude edged lower from earlier highs near $78 to around $76.60 per barrel, maintaining elevated levels due to supply concerns tied to ongoing Middle East hostilities .
Market sentiment is tempered by cautious central bank signals and political tensions, with the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady while warning of inflationary effects from tariffs and military spending . U.S. markets remain closed for Juneteenth, and investors are now looking ahead to rate decisions from the Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, and Norges Bank. As the day progresses, focus will centre on any intelligence that indicates a U.S. military move in the Middle East and updates from the central banks, both of which could influence the tone of global markets.

The stock is also trailing as the broader financial sector faces cautious sentiment in a mixed market environment.
Indian equities started the day on a muted note and slipped into the red soon after the open. The Nifty 50, which opened at 24,803.25, fell over 50 points, while the Sensex declined more than 80 points after starting at 81,403.94.
Volatility remains elevated, with the Nifty having declined in four of the last five sessions. Mid- and small-cap stocks continue to face pressure, though key support levels are being respected. The index’s low of 24,700 for the week remains a crucial downside marker, while 25,000 continues to pose strong resistance.
Crude oil prices continue to trade higher, dampening investor sentiment in Indian markets. Domestically, alongside the weekly F&O expiry, markets are also dealing with shareholder lock-ins ending and block deals across several counters, adding to near-term volatility.
Globally, the U.S. Fed held rates steady but projected higher inflation, slower growth, and rising unemployment - triggering a sharp reversal on Wall Street. Heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have further weighed on risk appetite.
However, the market recovered as at 9:45 AM, the Nifty 50 was up 28.90 points (+0.12%) at 24,840.95, while the Sensex gained 78.31 points (+0.096%) to trade at 81,522.97.
## **Global Markets Slip as Geopolitical Risks Rise and Central Banks Hold Cautious Tone**
Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Thursday as investors assessed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged and kept a close watch on rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. Japan’s Nikkei 225 opened 0.27% lower, while the broader Topix slipped 0.12%. In contrast, South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.76%, with the Kosdaq also in the green, up 0.37%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was largely flat in early trade, reflecting cautious sentiment across the region.
Overnight in the U.S., Wall Street ended on a mixed note after the Fed maintained a status quo on rates but flagged concerns over inflation, slower growth, and rising unemployment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 44.14 points, or 0.10%, to close at 42,171.66. The S&P 500 edged lower by 0.03% to 5,980.87, while the Nasdaq Composite managed to close slightly higher, rising 0.13% to settle at 19,546.27. The tone remains cautious, with global markets closely tracking macroeconomic signals and geopolitical developments.
## **Commodities & Currency Update | June 19 | 10:30 AM**
Gold prices edged higher in early trade on Thursday as investors sought safety amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. Spot gold was trading near $3,378 per ounce globally, while in the domestic market, 24-carat gold was quoted around ₹99,540 per 10 grams. The persistent Israel-Iran conflict has supported bullion prices, although analysts at Citi project a potential correction by late 2026 if geopolitical tensions ease and the US begins cutting rates.
Crude oil remained volatile, with Brent crude hovering near $76.50 per barrel. Price swings were driven by speculation over possible US military involvement in the region. June has already witnessed a nearly 10% rise in oil prices, with a geopolitical premium built in. Technical charts indicate near-term upside unless key support levels break.
The US dollar held firm, supported by a broad risk-off mood and safe-haven buying. Emerging market currencies remained under pressure, with the Indian rupee weakening for the third consecutive session. The rupee opened 6 paise lower at 86.53 against the dollar, marking its lowest level since April 9, according to Bloomberg data. The currency has slipped 1.13% so far in June.
Traders noted continued dollar demand from oil importers and foreign portfolio investors. The Reserve Bank of India was reportedly active in the forex market, selling dollars at 85.35 and later at 85.55 levels to curb excessive volatility.
