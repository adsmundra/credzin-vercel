# HDFC Bank Regalia Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review

HDFC Regalia must be the most common card among HDFC credit cardholders and is offered as a super-premium offering from HDFC Bank positioned just below the HDFC luxury twinsHDFC Infinia Credit Cardand HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card. However, I would like to rate it as a mid-range premium card. Here’s everything you wish to know about the card.

HDFC Bank has a dedicated portal namedSmartBuywith which we get some extra rewards and cashback. The strategy for maximizing gains viaSmartBuyhas been shared later in the article.

TechnoFino Tip

Align your billing cycle of the HDFC Credit Cards as much as possible with the calendar month by asking the bank to shift your billing cycle date to the 2nd of every month to minimize the calculations related to the capping of CashPoints andSmartBuycashback. HDFC doesn’t allow the first and last two days of the month as your billing cycle date.

HDFC Regalia gives the most value when redemption is done for flights and hotel bookings and not for cashback. We would highly recommend you go for travel redemptions instead of cash. And if your points are near expiry and you don’t have a travel plan in the near future then redeem them for Amazon vouchers which is equivalent to cash instead of going for a statement credit.

Regalia rewards highly only high spenders who can reach at least ₹5L spend milestone. Below that threshold reward rate is really poor. I wish they had given a standard reward rate of 2% on all spending for a card of this category.

Access Via – Credit CardDomestic Limit– 2 Visits/ Calendar quarter within India on spending ₹1Lakh in previous calendar quarter (Shared between Primary & maximum 3 Add-on cardholders but both cards cannot be used for the same lounge, same day).Network – Visa Signature/ MasterCard World

But with theGlobal Value Programof HDFC Bank which is offered on Regalia, you can get 1% cashback on all international spends and thus you spend at no loss no gain. I will be covering this later in detail in an article.

Officially the bank has the following criteria but can vary as per your relationship with the bank.

For Salaried Indian national

For Self Employed Indian national

Unofficially, If you are an existing HDFC Credit Cardholder then you can ask for an upgrade if there is a 3L limit on your existing card.

HDFC Regalia Credit Card is a highly rewarding and lifestyle credit card. Though some people find this card a tad bit expensive but the value it offers, over its younger avatar calledHDFC Millennia Credit Card, justifies the fee as the ceiling of the HDFCSmartBuyrewards gets higher plus the reward points become uncapped. But the card’s real worth can only be realized if you can go for travel redemptions. Although racking up reward points is a bit difficult now compared to the olden days since its devaluation twice but still, its charm is not all lost.

Also, the shared domestic and international lounge access is unique to a card of this price range and will make your international travels comfortable plus save you a lot of money on the expensive meals you may have with your family while hopping airports. As of now HDFC is not issuing this card openly and onlyHDFC Regalia Goldis being pushed to new customers.
