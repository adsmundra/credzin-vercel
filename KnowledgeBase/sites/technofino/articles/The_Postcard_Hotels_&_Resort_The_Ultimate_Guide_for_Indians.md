The Postcard Hotels and Resorts, a boutique hotel chain, redefines luxury with an infusion of Indian hospitality, promising an intimate and unforgettable experience. This brand introduces a fresh perspective, founded by Kapil Chopra, a veteran with decades of experience in the hospitality industry, including his tenure as President of The Oberoi Hotels. Alongside notable figures like Akansha Lamba and Anirudh Kandhpal, The Postcard Hotels aims to revive the essence of the “Old Way of Holidaying“, offering distinctive perks and a transformative approach to luxury.

With an international footprint in Sri Lanka and Bhutan, The Postcard Hotels currently operates nine properties with the rest of them in India. They are also building India’s most expensive hotel in Ranthambore, Rajasthan which is among the five others under construction. Since its launch in 2018, they have been rapidly expanding towards its ambitious goal of encompassing 50 hotels within its portfolio.

The Postcard Hotels have a unique take on hospitality. They aim to identify the needs of the leisure traveller and solve problems that the hospitality industry, in general, is having.

The Postcard Hotels have recently introduced their exclusive loyalty program, theSunshine Club, offering a refreshingly simple and transparent approach. Unlike most other traditional hotel loyalty programs where points have fixed or variable values, Sunshine Club points function like cashback. This means that each point is equivalent to the corresponding amount in your invoice that you can offset using your points balance.

The Sunshine Club features three distinct levels: Gold, Platinum, and Black, each offering its own set of benefits.

Now, with AMEX Membership Reward Points, you have the opportunity to directly redeem your stays at The Postcard Hotels. Currently, there are three enticing redemption options available:

WithEazyDiner‘s Eazypoints redemption, you can enjoy a complimentary one-night stay at The Postcard Hotels, including breakfast. The points are earned when you dine out at nearby restaurants that too on huge discounts. However, it requires booking a minimum of two nights, with one night being paid.

The redemption points vary across different properties:

There are numerous discount offers always running with various banking partners for booking a stay in any of The Postcard Hotels which are dynamic. We are listing some of the ongoing offers here.

When you book with Axis Bank Burgundy Private credit card or Axis Bank Reserve credit card, you’re entitled to a 15% instant discount on your booking. This offer is valid for a minimum booking of 2 nights.

When booking with an ICICI Bank credit card, debit card, or net banking, you can enjoy a 25% discount, up to ₹5,000 per room. This discount is applicable for a maximum of 3 rooms per booking.

The Postcard Hotel prides itself on offering top-tier hospitality that meets global standards. The unique perks like Anytime Breakfast, Anytime Check-in and Check-out are potential market disruptors. While currently operating a limited number of properties, the brand harbours ambitious expansion plans. Although their loyalty program may not initially captivate enthusiasts due to the absence of a banking transfer partner, I firmly believe they are actively working to enhance the program. Their recent collaboration with AMEX for stay redemptions using Membership Reward Points suggests a promising future strategy to broaden their appeal to a wider audience of travellers seeking intimate luxury experiences using their reward points.
