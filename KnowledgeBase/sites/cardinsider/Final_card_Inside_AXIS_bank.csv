There is no such thing as Google Pay wallet.

Can I use axis Bank ace credit card in small grocery shops and other small stores. Does it charge
Yes you can use your Axis Bank Ace Credit Card at small stores also. You shall also receive 2% cashback for the same.
If I use axis bank ace credit card linked gpay scanner in small grocery shop, would it be eligible for 1.5% cash back?
I added Axis Bank Ace credit card to gpay today. In small grocery shops where they have bar code scanner, if I scan, in the payment options, this credit card is not shown. So obviously wherever card machine is available, we can use this card. Not in small grocery shops where only bar code scanner is there
For small shops you should get a rupay as most of them has payment option through rupay enabled also its indian unlike mastercard and visa so obviously rupay version cards have an edge here
Many small shops do not accept payments through RuPay Credit Cards on UPI. Most turn them off."

Axis Bank Atlas Credit Card membership comes in three tiers- Silver Tier, Gold Tier, and Platinum Tier. A particular customer’s membership tier depends upon their annual spending with the card. If a cardholder is spending ₹7.5 lacs or less in an annual year, he will be falling under Silver Tier Membership, but if he is spending between ₹7.5 lacs to ₹15 lacs, he will be under Gold Tier Membership, and if his annual spends of the year exceeds ₹15 lacs, he will be considered under Platinum Tier Membership. The same is depicted in the table below-
The membership tiers are different in terms of the number of Edge Miles that you get as a renewal benefit and the number of domestic/international airport lounge access you get annually.
Your membership Tier will be downgraded from next year onwards if you are not able to maintain the minimum spend with your Axis Bank Atlas Credit Card in the current year according to the tier in which you fall. You will remain in the same tier, i.e., Silver Tier if you spend ₹7.5 lacs or less in the current year. Now, if you were in the Gold Tier but in the current year, your annual expenditures are less than ₹7.5 lacs, you will be downgraded to Silver Tier Membership. Adding to this, if based on your annual spending, you were a part of Platinum Tier Membership, but in the current year, your annual spending falls below ₹15 lacs, You will be downgraded from Platinum Tier Membership to Silver or Gold Tier Membership. This can be explained in a tabular form in the following way-
Silver (for Spends Less Than ₹7.5 Lakh)
Gold (for Spend Between ₹7.5 Lakh & ₹15 Lakh )
You get Bonus Edge Miles on your Atlas Credit Card annually once the renewal fee is paid. The number of Bonus Miles received as the annual benefit is different for each of the tiers of the card membership.
A particular spend amount is pre-decided by the bank for each tier. Upon achieving that milestone spend the amount of your respective tier, and you will be credited with Bonus Edge Miles of your tier. You get Bonus Edge Miles on achieving the spend targets with your Axis Bank Atlas Credit Card.
Transactions made for Gold/Jewellery, Rent, Wallet, Government Institutions, Insurance, Fuel, and Utilities merchants will not be counted towards Milestone achievement and Tier evaluation thresholds.

FAQs:
Is complimentary air tkt provided by company on renewal of card on next year ?
No, they’ll give you edge miles on the basis of membership tier
What is the reward rate on foreign transactions, it is same 2 points per 100 or it is 4 points per 100 on foreign currency transactions
Axis bank or more like AXE Bank. they wont let me redeem my points because they think I made business transactions. What kind of drama is this.
As a parent, I prioritize family vacations. The Atlas card has been instrumental in making those trips more affordable. The free lounge access makes waiting at airports less stressful for everyone, and the reward points allow me to stretch our travel budget further. It’s definitely a family-friendly card!
Can i pay my taxes & get milestone benefits?
No
Does spending on an add-on card count toward a tier upgrade for this card?
I dont know much about non-cashback credit cards. I have expenses at Golden Tulip Hotels in Jaipur worth 18k every month from (April-November), and I will also have around 3L INR expenses coming up at the same hotel in December-February. Could someone guide me on whether this card would be good for this particular expense? I wont have any flight expenses, just this Golden Tulip expense. I’m looking to maximise any returns for this huge expense."

N/A","The Axis Bank Horizon Credit Card is a travel-centric credit card, offering generous rewards and travel benefits. If you are familiar with Axis Credit Cards, you may recognize this card as the basic version of the popular Atlas Credit Card . The joining charge for this card is ₹3,000, and the same amount is charged as an annual fee. While the premium features of this travel credit card justify the fee, there is a slight drawback as there is no spend-based annual fee waiver, so you would have to pay the fees. This card is most beneficial for those who want to earn accelerated rewards for travel bookings and are looking for complimentary airport lounge access.
The Axis Horizon Credit Card is available in Mastercard World and Visa Signature variants, both of which offer distinctive features and rewards. There is a slight difference in the number of domestic airport lounge visits offered. With the Mastercard variant, you would get six complimentary visits, and with the Visa variant, you would get eight. If you want to learn more about this card, keep reading for an in-depth look.
Joining and Renewal Benefits
Axis Bank Horizon Credit Cardholders will receive 5,000 EDGE Miles as a welcome benefit on purchases of ₹1,000 or more within the first 30 days of receiving the card.

FAQs:
I have an existing Citi premier miles card …when would that be converted into a horizon’s card ?
You must have gotten the new card by now.
I like that the Axis Bank Horizon Credit Card offers a variety of transfer partners, such as Krisflyer and Flying Blue. However, the annual limit on points transfer can be a bit of a drawback if you spend a lot.
Axis Bank Horizon is the little brother of Atlas Credit Card.
How does the lounge access benefit compare with other travel credit cards like Axis Atlas or SBI Miles Elite?"

FAQs:
wrong info about international lounge access unlimited for card holders and 8 guest pass per year.
Hi, thanks for pointing this out. The card was recently updated with new features.
Are you aware of any limitations on maximum of 6000 edge reward points per transaction on this card? That means transaction limit of ₹1,00,000. I have this card and made a transaction of more than 1L, but received only 6K points. Axis customer service being as useless as ever where front-end support opens a SR saying you should get for entire value but back-end support closes it saying 6000 is the limit without citing any T&C.
I have done a transaction of more than 1 lac and have got more than 6000 points on that transaction.
HEY, just applied and got approved for the card, waiting for the delivery, I was wondering if this is a metal card? if yes, then is the quality of metal comparable to HDFC Infinia metal card?
Yes, the Magnus card is a Metal card and the quality is similar to Infinia.
Some users are saying it’s quality is not similar to infinia, is that right?
We have both Infinia Metal and Magnus Metal. The Magnus metal is lighter than Infinia Metal, but overall both cards are solid.
received the card few days back. just wanna clarify one thing; do I need to show priority pass to access the domestic lounges or just my Magnus card?
Dont use priority pass for domestic,  if u use priority pass they will charge 27$ plus taxes in India, priority pass is only for international, i mean  outside country.
Hi,
I have a couple of questions? Would you prefer it on Visa or Mastercard? What’s the difference? Is there any chance to get it LTF? Can I transfer my balance from other credit card to Axis Credit Cards? If yes then what are the charges?
Thank you so much

Domestic lounges have become too crowded these days. They queue for entry is also never ending. Can the Priority Pass be used to access “The Exclusive Lounges” like the one in Hyderabad which is just opposite the regular domestic lounge. Is International Travel boarding pass mandatory to use this lounge or can the same be availed with domestic boarding pass as well. Thanks
i dont see ITC club while converting the points. Is it still available?
If I link my HDFC infinia credit card to Google-pay, and pay for govt transactions, will I get reward points? or will I atleast bypass the additional credit card gateway fees?
Hello, Sir. Only RuPay Credit Cards can be linked to UPI.
I am doing a calculation. I buy Reliance Digital Gift Cards for ₹249900 as I want to buy a MacBook Pro. I will also get the 5X RP mean of 75000 RP So basically I will get 75000RP*0.8*1.8=108000 worth in ACCOR. This means my MacBook Pro will cost me Rs.250000-108000=Rs.142000/-
Am I right on the calculation?
and you get extra 25000 points as monthly milestone benefit as well.
On website it says that milestone benefits are applicable from the month of card issuance itself . However you have mentioned that it is applicable from the next month. Please clarify
It’s from the 1st month itself. Updated the article.
Hi
You mentioned insurance premium amount is not counted for milestone benefit. Are you sure? Because the following article doesn’t say so: https://www.axisbank.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/25k-edge-rewards-tnc.pdf
Hi Sandy, thanks updated the article. Rent and wallet is excluded.
I have card and used it multiple times to book flights via travel edge. However, the bonus points have not been credited. Is there a wait time for travel edge 5x bonus points to get credited, or should I reach out to someone?
Isn’t there a limit of 10k points, per month per customer? Total points is 35000. And with Accor, a reduction of 50k.
limit is only on grabdeals.
I have salary of 10lacs per annum…. And I hav citi bank credit card (2lac limit) and axis bank ace(1lac limit) Can I apply for magnus credit card
Here are the easiest way to get Magnus without huge ITR or huge Limit, I have help almost all my friend circle. 1) Use your Citi card statement and mail to axis with your salary slips to increase limit and match as citi for your Axis Ace. or 1) Apple Card 2 Card any random low variant cc so via bank offline or agent so that you get 2Lac Limit 2) Wait for 3 Month or sometime even less. 3) Open Axis Mobile App, Credit Cards > Scroll Bottom, do not select any card > there would be new a button “Apply Now’ Click there 4) Fill the details and go next, Now if your coll down period ie. step 2 is over then you will get a credit card list which are pre-approved. 5) For magus you need at least 2Lac on existing axis card, and Voila you will see Magnus in that list. 6) Thank me later, New Year Gift hehe 😛
Hi, I’ve a couple of questions. 1. What’s the difference between Magnus VISA & Magnus Master card on usage / restrictions and please suggest the best. 2. Regarding International Airport Lounge Program, whether the guest of the card holder (like wife travelling along with the card holder) can also avail the offer.? If so, what’s the limitation ?
I was travelling internationally in last 3 weeks. Whichever airport lounges I asked, none of them accept this card (Canada, Germany, France, Dubai). can anyone share which airports and which lounges accept this cad?
are jewellery purchase counted in magnus 1 lac spends per month cretiria and if yes also can i buy kalyan jeweller gift card from gift edge at 5x and take benefit??
yes
Anyone has got the 25000 point for the month of march 23?
hi…will I get any edge reward points if I pay my electricity & other utility bills through  Magnus CC?
Bonus of 25000 points on spending of 1 lakh and more has been withdrawn by axis on magnus card. now it is making magnus less attractive
25K points on 1L spend has been withdrawn.. besides a lot of other degradations on the card. There’s a spectacular degradation on this card which makes the WORST card among all premium cards. Stay away from this card (Unless you are a Burgundy account holder)
Ankur One Point to change. AXIS is now Offering Magnus in MasterCard World from Dec 20th, So we can avail Gold benefits via Master Card.
World Mastercard cardholders can enjoy the following privileges: – 4 complimentary rounds of green fees per calendar year (not more than 1 round in a single calendar month) – 12 complimentary golf lessons per calendar year (1 lesson per calendar month) – Discounted golf services at 50% of the green fee beyond complimentary sessions
This card is just hyped way too much. After devaluation the return rate is just 1.2 to 2% max. 1 edge point is 0.2 rs vs 1 point =1 inr for HDFC Infinia and Diners black. Don’t be fooled, I have cancelled my card after devaluation( removal of 25000 point on 1 lakh spends). Even when this offer was there the return rate was about 5% max..  25000*0.2 rs =5000 rs for every 1L spend.
Is there a cap for edge reward points through a Magnus Burgundy card from Grab Deals?"

FAQs:
For the fees we are paying the joining benefit doesn’t look attractive, what do you think?
They want to target those who spend Crores on Credit cards
Axis cards have habit of going back on benefits after someti.e, like magnus benefits were downgraded with concierge services withdrawn. I am not tempted.
Well you can easily get your fees back if you consider transfer to accor and 1 accor point= 1.8rs.. so easily recoverable if you use accor.. however yeah the fees is tooo much if you are not into hotel/miles game like me… However, it is still a well defined card with good reward structure. The target audience are people who travel in bussiness class and above so richie rich people basically.
Does Govt spending such as Income tax / GST payment is included in rewards rate…
Yes. All spends made with this card are rewarded
I was planning to use this card for marriage functions of Anant and Radhika. Sadly my eligibility was rejected
Interested credit card apply Link plz send
Optimus Prime of Indian credit cards..!!!
I am interested in this card. What’s the eligibility. I am ok with paying this annual fee as long as it stays restriction free.
Eligibility is yet to be announced.
EDGE Mile earning is restriction free on the Axis Primus Credit Card.
HI Kartik, Tax payments ? I am currently using  HDFC Biz black for tax payments
Regards Navin
Is there any document or weblink which confirms this claim ?
Also, any idea when would this card be officially launched ?
So in terms of mile and value if we cancel the amex platinum with 60,000 fees and have this will this give better returns?
Depends whether you are an ultra high spender or not. Only those with very high quarterly spends in tunes of 50 lakh each quarter can get the maximum from this card. Even the airfare privilege shall be available on full fare rates.
Axis Magnus Burgundy is much more better in my opinion. Even Axis Atlas is better with so low fees & better reward rate when accelerated.
But they have restrictions in transferring to partner airmiles, in year only 30000 only, which is very bad thing. Only thing there shouldn’t be limit for airmile transfer."

Hi all. Have been using Citi rewards credit card for the last 4 years. Have been offered axis rewards credit card in lieu of the same post Citi to axis migration. Axis wants to retain the existing Citi customers so Axis has kept the annual fees reversal criteria of 30000 per annum (as was with Citi) and added two new features- 2 domestic lounges PQ and 2 PM swiggy 30% off. I earlier thought of giving up the card but now I am happy. Interesting thing is Citi never asked me for fees once my annual spends crossed 30K so there was no question of reversal. I hope axis follows the same.
I have migrated to Axis Bank from Citibank.  I had a life time free credit card with Citibank.  I have recieved a Axis Bank  rewards card .Do i need to pay to  the  joining  and renewal fee for the  new card?"

Axis bank has devalued most of their credit cards today. This comes as a huge disappointment. Please update the document with the new criteria and reward rates.
This page reflects the current valid information.
Axis bank is slowly reducing benefits in it’s cards. For example, Swiggy 200 /- benefit was earlier applicable on purchase of 500/-, has now been increased to 1000/-. In percentage terms the benefits are 20% in comparison to earlier 40%. For other benefits I have better offering cards from other banks like BOB eterna, IDFC FIRST and of course HDFC diners black. Squeezing out customers will not help. I will be looking for VFM. I had earlier cancelled My Zone card for the same and before next renewal I will cancel my select card as well. I am having Axis cards for Swiggy benefits only. So, if these are not there, I have no requirement of these cards.
The card offers valuable life insurance coverage, including protection for air travel accidents and purchase protection, which make it a great choice for premium users."

January, 2025 Update
The Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card now offers 5% cashback on ClearTrip. Earlier, it used to provide 4% cashback.
ClearTrip is an online travel booking platform of Flipkart.
April, 2024 Update
Important changes have been made to most of the major Axis Bank Credit Cards, and many cards have been devalued. Below are the changes that will be applicable to the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card from 20th April 2024.
Starting from 20 April 2024, all transactions made using the FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card, except for those made on Flipkart, preferred merchants, and cashback-excluded categories, will earn a base cashback of 1% instead of the previous 1.5%.
The free airport lounge access benefits will now be based on spending in the previous three calendar months. To avail of complimentary lounge access from 1st May 2024 onwards, you must have spent a minimum of Rs. 50,000 in the previous three months.
February, 2024 Update
Starting from February 15th, 2024, TataPlay will no longer be considered a preferred merchant for the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card.

What do you think of this co-branded credit card? Which one would you pick between the two? Please let us know in the comments below.
When we have to repay our credit card spend of Flipkart axis Bank credit card
Usually you would have to pay your credit cards dues between a cycle of 30 to 50 days.
I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent experience with Flipkart. Despite assurances of a 5% cashback on my Flipkart Axis Credit Card at the time of purchase, Axis Bank denied the cashback for my order. This issue was compounded by Flipkart’s return policy, which does not allow returns, resulting in overall dissatisfaction with the transaction. This experience has highlighted the challenges of relying on cashback offers without clear disclosure of potential limitations, significantly affecting my trust in Flipkart’s promotional transparency and customer service reliability.
Do we get 1.5% chasback on LIC insurance payment using the Flipkart Axis Bank Crdit Card?
No, insurance payments are not eligible for cashback.
This is now useless card. Much changes by Axis Bank so now zero use. in my statement I see zero cashback on utilities, insurance, govt service like exam fee payment.
Are there any hidden perks or features of the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card that we might miss?
All benefits are mentioned above.
I am confused between the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card and the Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card. Can you help me choose the best option?
If you regularly purchase from Flipkart you should opt for the Flipkart Axis. Whereas Amazon loyalist should go with the Amazon ICICI Bank Credit Card. These co-branded cards have their unique benefit and are centered around one or the other e-commerce platform.
Here , for offline transactions cashback is 1% But on flipkart app it is showing 1.5% for the same.. HOW
Because from 20th April the terms regarding the card shall be changed. This page reflects the latest updates.
I got this card last week. As i am a Axis bank account holder plus have their other credit card, they have given me this within a week time. Every time i use this card for any purchase for any amount on Flipkart, Myntra i get 5% cash back except for EMI transactions. 4% on Uber and Uber eats. 1.5% on all other spends (like used in any stores). As a joining benefit will get Rs.500 Flipkart voucher. The cashback will be added after few days to the card statement. I would definitely recommend this card for everyone.
How much time will it take to reach the customer after applying for a Flipkart Axis Bank credit card?
You shall receive the card in 7 to 10 days once application is approved.
Earlier when my husband received the card, he got more welcome benefits, but when I got my Flipkart Axis credit card I received fewer welcome benefits.
Yes, welcome benefits have now been reduced.
I own an HDFC credit card and i receive 1000 points as a welcome bonus, but they’re no bonus at all on the Flipkart Axis Bank credit card. Moreover, the cashback i got from Axis Bank is only redeemable on Flipkart.
I own this card firstly there was zero welcome bonus from the bank, Secondly the minimum annual expenditure is very high for such a card, I want to switch to another card coz m not getting any special benefits even some other cards with no annual fee are offering better.
There is an error redeeming the voucher when i was redeeming it said the voucher was already redeemed. The problem was solved later on but it should not be happening.
What is your interest rate for due payments, and how many did you inform your customer regarding bill payments?  Do you guys also increase the card limit for long-term users If so, for how long one has to hold the card?
How many cards can i hold at a time and how to apply? What are the advantages of using it abroad and can i also increase the limit of this card?
I want to exceed the limit of this credit card what are the requirements for that?
You can check your Bank’s app or contact the bank directly to see if you are eligible for any upgrades.

Always thought this was not such a great card. But just now used it on Cleartrip and got like a voucher off of Rs. 1,000 and 4% cashback. So yeah its beneficial for Flipkart, Cleartrip and even Swiggy. One of the most underrated aspect has to be the unlimited cashback feature.

Comparison of Axis IndianOil Credit Cards
IndianOil recently introduced two variants of its credit card: the entry-level IndianOil card and the mid-level IndianOil Axis Premium Credit Card. For those interested in additional features and willing to pay a slightly higher fee, the IndianOil Premium Credit Card is a good option, while others can opt for the basic card. Both cards offer nice features, and the choice depends on individual needs.
Brief Review of IndianOil Axis Premium Credit Card
The IndianOil Axis Premium Credit Card is a fantastic option for those who frequently spend on fuel or those looking for their first fuel credit card. With a generous reward rate of 6X EDGE Miles per ₹150 spent at IndianOil outlets, it makes fueling up both economical and rewarding. The card also offers 2X EDGE Miles on grocery spending and 1X EDGE Miles on other eligible expenses, providing a well-rounded rewards program for everyday spending.
One of the standout features of this card is its complimentary airport lounge access. Cardholders can enjoy up to two free domestic lounge visits each quarter, making travel more comfortable. However, this benefit is tied to a spending criterion of ₹50,000 in the previous three months, which may be challenging for some users to meet since this card is primarily useful for fuel spending.
The 30% discount on Zomato twice a month adds significant value, making it easier to enjoy savings on food deliveries.
The IndianOil Axis Premium Credit Card is a great option for people who frequently purchase fuel and groceries and want to earn rewards and benefits. However, it’s important to be mindful of the limits on accelerated EDGE Miles earning with this card and keep track of your spending in order to maximize the benefits.
FAQs:
You will not get accelerated rewards for every Indian Oil fuel transaction but for the ones where fuel station is in AXIS BANK RULE MERCHANT BOOK. Now what all fuel station are there in Rule merchant book of Axis bank is the missing link here and it is available no where.
This is simply not true. It is clearly stated in the terms at any IOCL fuel station in India.
Yes it is stated, but i might have fueled my vehicle at 4 different IOCL outlets and no where i received 6X edge miles and surcharge wavier was also not honored. Had complained to customer care and the revert was simple- “you had refueled at non IOCL fuel outlet” . I went ahead and complained to their nodal officer where this time i had even put the slips the transactions  done at IOCL . Even then they didn’t nudge and now i have filed a case with RBI where they came down on their knees and then rewarded 6x edge miles and fuel surcharge was also reversed (I’m fighting for compensation for all neglecting my complaint at different levels and honoring only when I reached RBI). Do check before you apply as customer would not know which IOCL fuel outlet would give him 6x edge miles and surcharge wavier (there is even no list of IOCL outlets on their website and i think bank expects customer to check for Axis machine before swiping our card ) . Whatever as mentioned on their website as any IOCL outlet doesn’t hold true. Only thing i can say is safeguard yourself from people who impersonate themselves as Axis bank employees and lure you with higher reward points but here Axis bank itself lures with higher reward points by mentioning the same as the card’s USP on their website as customer can fuel up at any IOCL fuel outlet upto INR15,000 in a month to get 6X edge miles."
