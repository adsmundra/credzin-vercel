Marriott Bonvoy has structured its loyalty program into several elite tiers, each offering a myriad of benefits to reward its most loyal members. Here’s an in-depth look into each tier, revealing how Indian travellers can maximize their travel experiences by leveraging these benefits.

This is the entry-level tier for every individual who joins Marriott Bonvoy.

Reached after 25 qualifying nights in a calendar year.

Achieved after 50 qualifying nights in a calendar year.

The Cobalt program is now the pinnacle of Marriott Bonvoy’s membership tiers, joining the existing levels of Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium. Originally part of the Ritz-Carlton Rewards as an exclusive, invitation-only tier, it now stands above all others in Marriott Bonvoy. Previously, Marriott Rewards had an elusive “Platinum Five Star” status, rumoured to be granted only by personal invitation from Bill Marriott himself.

Cobalt status does not have publicly available criteria for attainment. Members can only be nominated by Marriott employees, and these nominations must be approved by Marriott International’s President and CEO before any contact is made with the potential member.

Essentially, Cobalt members enjoy the benefits of Ambassador Elite status with additional perks that vary by brand within the Marriott portfolio. At budget-friendly brands, Cobalt members receive the best available room and a personalized note or a meet-and-greet with the General Manager. At full-service properties, they will meet the GM and receive a personalized amenity. Luxury brands offer an enhanced experience and club lounge access at Ritz-Carlton hotels. Cobalt members are assured an exceptional level of personalized service throughout their stay.

Marriott Bonvoy Lifetime Elite status is a prestigious recognition awarded to members who have shown long-term loyalty to the Marriott hotel chain. This status comes in three tiers: Silver, Gold, and Platinum Elite, each offering a unique set of benefits. To attain Lifetime Elite Status, members need to fulfil specific requirements in terms of Elite Nights and years of Elite membership.

Marriott Bonvoy has one of the most complicated and unnecessary breakfast benefit rules when it comes to any elite hotel chain and even die-hard Marriott loyalists won’t know them all. I will try to uncomplicate things a bit by mentioning some broad points as per their policies.

The following Marriott brandsoffer all guests complimentary breakfastirrespective of their elite status:

The following Marriott brandsdon’t offer even elite members complimentary breakfast:

Further, if you are a MarriottPlatinum, Titanium and Ambassador Elitemember then you can choose a welcome amenity upon check-in at most participating hotels which includes a breakfast option.

The most loved benefit of Marriot Bonvoy is its executive lounge access which is another way to receive complimentary breakfast.

The following brands guarantee lounge access to Platinum, Titanium and Ambassador Elite members only at their hotels and not the resorts:

Alas, there is no way to access Ritz-Carlton clubs using any elite status. If the above-mentioned brand properties have their lounge closed or if a lounge is not available at all then you will receive complimentary breakfast in the restaurant or you can choose to receive some bonus points in your Marriott Account.

The Marriott STARS and Luminous programs are elite travel agency programs that allow travellers to access unique benefits, personalized touches, and special amenities at select Marriott International luxury hotels. These programs are typically accessible through travel advisors affiliated with Marriott International’s luxury brands.

The STARS program is designed for an array of luxury brands within the Marriott International portfolio, including The Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, and The Luxury Collection. Guests booking through this program can enjoy exclusive benefits such as:

In India, Marriott Bonvoy Points can be accrued through several avenues, facilitating travellers to explore more perks and benefits.

Marriott currently has only one co-branded card in India, which is partnered with HDFC Bank. This card is on Diners Club platform, being the 3rd card from HDFC Bank which is on Diners Club platform. HDFC and Marriott are targeting new customers who are still not into the Bonvoy Program yet, which can be observed by the features of the card:

ICICI Bank is also in the process of launching its co-branded card with Marriott, though no confirmed news has surfaced yet.

Staying at Marriott-branded hotels and their partners is a direct way to earn points. Regular members, Silver Elite, Gold Elite, Platinum Elite, Titanium Elite, and Ambassador Elite earn 10, 11, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 17.5 points per USD respectively on qualifying charges. It also varies from the categories of the hotel brands. Please visit theofficial websitefor further details and any future changes or modifications.

Points can be transferred from partner programs, such as credit card reward programs, to Marriott Bonvoy. Credit cards from banks like American Express and Axis Bank allow the transfer of their reward points to Marriott Bonvoy points.

Listing a few important points transfer partners:

In India, you can transfer from 3 Loyalty Programs’ points to Marriott Bonvoy Points, namely Club ITC,United MileagePlusand Japan Airline.

Even without a stay, dining at Marriott’s participating restaurants and availing spa services at Marriott properties could potentially earn members Bonvoy points.

Organizing events or meetings at participating Marriott hotels can also accrue points. One can earn a maximum of 60,000 points per event. However, the Marriott Elites can earn a bonus on these events and can stack up to a 75% bonus depending on their elite status.

Regularly check Marriott Bonvoy’s official site for any ongoing offers, promotions, or challenges that might offer additional points or faster ways to earn them.

Marriott Bonvoy will send you Bonvoy Points for referring friends to the program. You can refer up to five new members each calendar year and earn 2,000 points for up to five of their paid stays. You can earn up to 50,000 points in a year with this and the friends you’ll refer will also earn 2,000 points at each of their stays.

One can transfer up to 1,00,000 Points per calendar year to another Bonvoy account and one can receive a maximum of 5,00,000 Bonvoy Points per calendar year. One needs to have an account created at least 30 days prior with a qualifying activity or created at least 90 days prior without a qualifying activity to perform this action.

Please note, that Marriott Bonvoy doesn’t allow trading points. Any suspicious activity may trigger to account review, suspension and up to permanent ban of the account. Please do transfer points where you’ll be able to give justifiable answers to Marriott Bonvoy if anything triggers the suspicious activity alert.

As with any other loyalty program, you do have the option to buy Marriott Bonvoy Points. Marriott often does run promotional offers of buying points, you can sometimes get up to 100% reward points with your purchases. 40-50% offers are quite common with Bonvoy promotion.

Please do note that buying points only makes sense when it’s needed or else try to transfer points from credit card partners.

The Marriott Bonvoy program offers a lucrative points system, allowing members to accumulate points and enjoy a range of benefits and services. However, it’s important to note that these points are subject to expiration if there is no account activity for24 months.

As per the official Marriott guidelines referenced, members need to ensure that they engage in qualifying activities to maintain the validity of their points. Qualifying activities can include making a stay at a participating hotel, earning or redeeming points, or any transaction that results in earning or using points. It is crucial to engage in at least one qualifying activity every 24 months to prevent points from expiring.Transferring or gifting points, or receiving them as gifts or transfers between Marriott Bonvoy members does not constitute a qualifying activity and will not prevent points from expiring due to inactivity.

Members lacking activity for five consecutive years risk account deactivation and irreversible point forfeiture. While the lost points can not be recovered, earning new points is possible, barring account deactivation. Maintaining active status is crucial to avoid these repercussions and to continue enjoying Marriott Bonvoy benefits.

Lifetime Elite Membership Accounts in Marriott Bonvoy are exempt from the Points expiration policy; their points currently do not expire.

Redeeming Marriott Bonvoy Points effectively enables members to experience various benefits and luxuries offered by Marriott. Here are several ways to redeem these points:

Redeem points for free stays at any Marriott Bonvoy property, with the number of points required varying by hotel category and availability. Prioritize high-value redemptions and use points during peak seasons or at luxury properties to maximize value. Bonvoy Points can typically be valued at ₹.50 per point on average. Considering the current state of Bonvoy Points which is now dynamic in nature, it’s always wise to plan vacations in an effective way to reduce the points burning and gain the maximum value of your points. Few tips while booking:

Marriott Bonvoy members can leverage their points effectively by transferring them to a multitude of airline partners, maximizing their reach and flexibility in travel options. The standard transfer ratio for most airlines is 3:1, but the value can differ depending on the partner. When transferring 60,000 points at once, Marriott provides a bonus, allowing members to receive 25,000 miles instead of the standard 20,000 with many airline partners. This advantageous conversion option enables members to optimize their points’ value by aligning them with diverse airline rewards programs, thereby accessing a broader spectrum of flight redemption opportunities, premium cabin availabilities, and global destinations. However, it is imperative to consider the transfer times, which can vary, and to research each airline’s award chart and availability to maximize the value obtained from each point transferred. You can only transfer between 3,000 to 2,40,000 points per day.

** A 5,000 Bonus offer will not be applicable for these Airline Partners.

This table contains most of the Marriott Bonvoy airline transfer partners, but always refer to theofficial Marriott websitefor the most current and accurate list, along with any additional details or restrictions.

Occasionally, Marriott offers PointSavers awards where rooms are available for fewer points than usually required. Regularly check thePointSaverspage on the Marriott website for available deals and book promptly as these are subject to availability.

Use points to enhance your stay with room upgrades. These could range from rooms with preferable views to luxurious suites, subject to availability. Before booking, check if your desired property allows room upgrades with points and inquire about availability. Alternatively, few properties do allow higher category rooms to be booked with Points or Points + Cash option, it can be beneficial if you’re looking for a guaranteed higher category room with Points.

Redeem points instantly at participating properties to cover incidental charges, such as meals, spa services, and more, right at the point of transaction. This option provides flexibility, allowing members to utilize points without pre-planning. This may not be the ideal “value-redemption” but an excellent option to be. This will come as ₹.20 per point valuation, so if you’re in absolute need of it, then only use the points.

Bid or redeem points for exclusive experiences, like intimate concerts, gourmet dinners, and special events, through Marriott Bonvoy Moments. These unique experiences can often offer high value and memorable returns on your points. You can browse through all the offers from theirofficial website.

Marriott Bonvoy Points can be redeemed for gift cards from various retailers, restaurants, and travel companies. Explore available gift card options within the Marriott Bonvoy online portal. Though this is not an ideal option, it’s a good-to-have option.

Points can be donated to charitable organizations through the “Donate Points” feature on the Marriott Bonvoy website, making it a thoughtful way to contribute to a cause. You can visitthis linkto head to the donation page.

Marriott Bonvoy’s Best Rate Guarantee ensures that guests receive the most competitive rates when booking directly through Marriott. If a guest finds a lower rate on a competing website within 24 hours of booking, Marriott promises not only to match that rate but also to give an additional 25% discount or 5,000 Marriott Bonvoy bonus points. This guarantee applies after verifying that the lower rate found is for the same hotel, room type, and dates and that it carries the same cancellation policy and other booking conditions.

To claim this, guests must submit aclaim form available on the Marriott websiteimmediately after booking and at least 24 hours before the standard check-in time. After verification, guests can choose either the additional discount or the bonus points. However, this does not apply to rates found on websites that package the room with other services or products, like airfare or vacation packages.

This policy highlights Marriott’s commitment to providing its guests with the most value, ensuring satisfaction and trust in the pricing provided on its booking channels.
