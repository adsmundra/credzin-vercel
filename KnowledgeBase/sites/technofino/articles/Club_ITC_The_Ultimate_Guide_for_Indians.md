Club ITC is a loyalty program offered by ITC Hotels, a chain of luxury hotels in India. The program is designed to reward its members for their loyalty and offer them exclusive benefits and privileges during their stays and visits to the ITC Group of Hotels. ITC Group of Hotels consists of 6 brands under a roof –

As a member of Club ITC, you can earn Green Points for your stays, dining, and other eligible spends at any ITC Hotel across India. These points can be redeemed for a range of rewards, including free stays, dining, spa services, and more. Additionally, members can enjoy a range of benefits, such as access to special rates, room upgrades, late check-out, and discounts on dining and other services.

Club ITC is loved by many because of its simplistic approach toward its redemption and its value. ITC has 81 Hotels across India and most of the hotels do participate in this loyalty program, WelcomHeritage being the exception.

Let’s break the discussion into four major parts: Club ITC, ITC Culinaire, Earning and Redemption of Green Points:

Club ITC is the base program which consists of 3 tiers namely base, Silver, Gold and Platinum. These tiers can be achieved by completing either of the two fulfilling criteria, i.e.

Each tier comes with its own upgrade & retention vouchers. Let’s see how these tiers benefit you:

This is the introductory tier. Just after enrolling on the Club ITC Program, you get granted this tier. With this tier, you’re entitled to get 10% off on the Flexible rate if booked directly with ITC Hotels. Also, you can earn 2% of the total eligible spending as Green Points.

With a stay of 6 Nights or spending of ₹60,000, you achieve this tier. If you book Suites for weekends, you’ll get 10% off on the Flexible rate if booked through the guest contact centre. Also, you can earn 3% of the total eligible spending as Green Points. Along with these, you can avail late check-out benefit till 2:00 PM.

Upgrade & Retention, You get 4 value vouchers which include:

With a stay of 16 Nights or spending of ₹1,60,000, you achieve this tier. If you book Suites for weekends, you’ll get 20% off on the Flexible rate if booked through the guest contact centre. Along with these, you can avail late check-out benefit till 4:00 PM. Apart from these, you get an enhanced room upgrade, which they may upgrade you to the ITC One/equivalent category at max, enhanced amenities will be provided. If you book for 1 person and you’re travelling with your spouse, the room charge will not be added, which also includes the standard addition of breakfast, and that’s a great value. Also, you can earn 4% of the total eligible spending as Green Points.

Upgrade & Retention, You get 4 value vouchers which include:

With a stay of 30 Nights or spending of ₹3,00,000, you achieve this tier. If you book Suites for weekends, you’ll get 20% off on the Flexible rate if booked through the guest contact centre. Apart from the added benefits of the Gold tier or Silver tier, you’re also eligible for a few great additional and enhanced perks such as a room upgrade to Standard Suites, and in-room tea/coffee service throughout your stay and this is apart from ready-to-make tea/coffee, Access to Towers/Upper Crust Lounge as a resident guest, and one more great feature such as 24-hour check-in check-out which need to be informed to the property’s front office prior 48 hours and can only be availed for 1 room only during the entire stay. Also, you can earn 5% of the total eligible spending as Green Points.

Upgrade & Retention, You get 8 value vouchers ( 2 of each) which include:

Club ITC Culinaire is a paid membership which gives additional benefits such as free stay, discount F&B vouchers, room upgrade vouchers etc. Club ITC Culinaire membership comes with two kinds of membership:

You can purchaseITC Culinaire Selectfor ₹14,000 + GST andITC Culinaire Elitefor ₹21,000 + GST. Alternatively, you can purchase both the membership with Green Points where you can buy a Select membership for 16,520 Green Points and the Elite membership for 24,780 Green Points. The only difference between the two memberships is the Free Night stay, where the Elite gives two but Select gives one. Here is the list ofParticipating Hotels. The best redemption options IMO are

Please note that accelerated earnings are not applicable at Fabelle.

Luxury Stays for Club ITC Culinaire Elite:Two e-certificates for a 1-night/2-days stay including buffet breakfast at participating hotels.

Luxury Stays for Club ITC Culinaire Select:One e-certificate for a 1-night/2-days stay including buffet breakfast at participating hotels.

Room Upgrade:Two e-certificates for a one-time room upgrade to the next category.

Luxury Getaways:Two e-certificates for 20% savings on the purchase of Welcombreak packages.

Culinary Delight:One e-certificate for 50% savings on the Food and beverage bill for a maximum of 4 guests.

Culinary Extravagance:Two e-certificates for 25% savings at all-day dining restaurants for a maximum of 4 guests.

Gourmet Delight:One e-certificate for 30% savings on purchases at the gourmet shop.

Sweet Indulgence:One e-certificate for a 1 Kg cake while dining.

Cards which come with Club ITC Culinaire:

Though these cards come with the benefits of Club ITC Culinaire, they’re toned versions, and both of them don’t offer the Free Night Stay instead they give a 3rd night stay on booking two revenue nights. They also offer just 1 room upgrade voucher instead of two. But they do provide two 50% and 20% off F&B Vouchers each.Alsoif you’ve both cardsthen onlyone card’s membership will be activated and the other onewill getforfeited.

Since there is no Co-branded card as of now in India, Axis Bank’s Reward Points, namely Edge Reward Points and Edge Miles are the only sources to earn the points without directly earning from the spending at ITC properties.

Earning Green Points when staying or dining at one of ITC’s many properties is the most obvious way to earn. ITC stays award Green Points as per the tier of member staying or dining. With the base tier, you get 2% equivalent Green points of the total spending done.

Having elite status with ITC not only allows you the upgraded perks as discussed above but also helps you earn accelerated Green Points.

Green Points is the Loyalty Currency of the Club ITC Loyalty program. Green Points redemption for award nights is pretty much straightforward. The standard value of Green Points is 1 GP = ₹1. Green Points supports universal redemption through the ITC eco-system, which means, you can settle anything and everything through Green Points including the taxes! Of course, there are some exceptions, like you can neither settle nor earn Green Points for room tariff if it’s booked by a third-party/agent at a discounted rate, but for other spends during your stay, you can avail of it.

Green Points redemption for your room reservation can be done in two ways:

For the first scenario, if booked directly via Green Points at the available property, you will definitely get more than ₹1 value per Green Point, but that option isn’t there many times and for many categories of rooms, usually Suites and excluded from direct Green Points booking. The redemption value is dynamic in this scenario which means it changes with the tariff changes of the room.

For the second scenario, you can easily settle the complete bill with Green Points with 1 GP = ₹1 value. In this scenario, you need to carry your physical membership card or you need to enable “contactless redemption” by verifying your credentials.

If you’re going to any restaurant of ITC hotels, you can settle the F&B bill with Green Points. You can combine your discount voucher with Club ITC Culinaire and Green Points to settle the bill.However, it’s advisable to pay the bill with a card or cash as you’ll be able to earn 25% of Green Points at minimum, which is a great bonus if you are a Culinaire Member. Alternatively, you redeem your GP for Food orders (Home delivery/ takeaways ) through the ITC Hotels app.

For the ‘Club ITC Member’ tier members, the validity of the Green Points earned or obtained through any means is 12 months, starting from the date of their last eligible stay at a participating hotel. However, it is possible to extend the validity of these points by staying at any ITC property and renewing them for another 12 months, which can be repeated subsequently.

On the other hand, if you are a Club ITC Culinaire member which is their topmost tier, or a Club ITC Platinum, Gold, or Silver member, your Green Points will not expire as long as you maintain your corresponding Club ITC status.

That’s all folks. As a person who’s really enjoying the stay and hospitality of ITC hotels and almost being Platinum, I can assure you that this is one hell of a membership where if you don’t want to spend a single penny, but can achieve the maximum tier by availing all other services at same redemption value, unlike its competitors.
