Axis Bank Airtel Credit Card is the latest offering of Axis Bank in collaboration with Airtel. Axis Bank is going all guns blazing with back-to-back new and decent product launches. Axis is already creating some noise among credit cardholders. This aggressive stance by Axis is good news for all the cardholders as the competition is only going to further increase from here. Let’s check out this card quickly in detail.

*Make the first transaction within the first 30 days of card issuance to be eligible for the voucher.

The joining fee is well compensated by a cash equivalent Amazon voucher. What needs to be seen is that will you be able to extract good value for next year out of it.

Just like other Axis cashback credit cards, the cashback will be given as statement credit 3 days prior to the next statement generation date without any request. Like if the statement date is 12th March, the cashback earned in the Feb month cycle (13th Jan-12th Feb) will be credited on 9th March.

Tomaximize the benefitsof this card you will have to spend ₹1,000 per month on Airtel services like Mobile recharges, broadband, and DTH services to get ₹250 worth of cashback. Paying utility bills worth ₹2500 will get you another ₹250 cashback. Another spend of ₹5,000 per month on preferred merchants like Swiggy, Zomato, and BigBasket will yield ₹500 worth of cashback every month. The 1% standard reward rate for all other spending is also an added benefit but less as compared to better cash-back cards available.

Access Via – Credit CardConditional Complimentary Domestic Limit – 4 Visits/Year

Being a starter card it may allow you access to selected lounges only so don’t make it your primary lounge card. Also very recently Axis Bank has added a minimum spending condition to this card ie one has to spend ₹50,000 in the previous quarter to avail of complimentary lounge access in the current quarter.

1% fuel surcharge waiver at all fuel stations across India. (On minimum transaction of ₹400 & maximum transaction of ₹4,000. Maximum waiver of ₹500 per statement cycle). GST charged on the surcharge will not be reversed.

Indulge in delectable cuisines and enjoy up to 20% off at 4000+ partner restaurants in India. You can check the complete listhere. But as compared to Zomato Pro and Dineout Passport, this offer stands nowhere.

These are the eligibility criteria as shown on the Axis Bank website for this card.

Applications for this card are currently being accepted via theAirtel Thanksapp also if you already have an Axis Bank credit card then you can simply call customer care and ask for a swap.

Axis customer care representative can be reached at18604195555 / 18605005555.

In my honest opinion, this card has anexceptionally good reward rate of 10%with a comfortable capping for an average consumer. Still, I am leaving the recommendation part for this card at an open end and at the discretion of the user as the card is only for a very specific set of users.

This card is ano-brainer for anyone with high exposure to Airtel products due to a whopping 25% reward rate even on prepaid recharges. With exceptional 10% reward rates on Swiggy, Zomato, and even Bigbasket this card can prove to be a great family card too.

Before taking the plungealso factor in the annual feesif you will be spending only on thetop three categoriesthen you willnotbe able toget a waiverand if you put yourgeneral spending from other highly rewarding cards on this cardthen it will prove to becounter-productive. So do your maths properly!

Comparable cashback cards areAxis AceandHSBC Cashbackwhich provide rewards in the same category as Axis Airtel.
