Since Axis Bank is new to the miles game, they have started rewarding this card differently. Instead of the usual EDGE rewards, you are entitled to EDGE Miles on this card.

Axis has shown some great innovation in the reward system of this card by introducing what they call a “Tier” system. In this the more you spend the more rewarding this card becomes.

Atlas credit cardholders’ tier will be evaluated at the beginning of each anniversary year based on the previous year’s card spending. But tier upgrades are being provided basis the spending in the middle of the year.

For example, if you get your card on 1st April 2022 and start with a Silver Tier and you spend ₹15L within let’s say 3 months then you get upgraded to Platinum Tier from that very same time and continue to enjoy it next year also. But if you fail to make the necessary spending in the year 2023-24 then you will be downgraded to Silver or Gold depending upon the spending you have achieved.

Overall the reward rates on this card are a bit low when redeemed for flights and hotels via the AXIS Travel EDGE portal since if we consider milestone benefits the overall reward rate comes out to be around 2% only.

However, the real value of this card can only be utilized when it is used to transfer air miles to partner airlines. Since the partner airlines keep on changing so I am attaching the link where we listed all thetransfer partnerson the TechnoFino Community.

TechnoFino Tip– Even if you still wish to do it then first transfer it toClub ITCand then transfer it to Bonvoy to get a 1 Edge Miles is to 3 Marriot Bonvoy points value with a maximum transfer capping of 10K points per quarter.

There is no fee waiver condition on this card so it tries to compensate it with milestone and annual benefits.

Atlas is overall a very good product if you like playing with the miles since direct redemption won’t give you much value. As mentioned in the beginning this card may prove to be complicated for someone who tries to chase the rewards by doing a back calculation before spending. That said, this card belongs to someone who has regular spending of at least ₹7.5LPA since below this threshold the reward rate is quite average. Further, consider this only if you are a lot into travelling.What are your thoughts on the new Axis Atlas credit card?
