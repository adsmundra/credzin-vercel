_**Editor’s note: This is a recurring post, regularly updated with new information and offers. Last Updated 18th January 2025.**_

In 2023, IndusInd announced its collaboration with Avios to launch a distinctive multi-branded credit card that shares the same frequent flyer currency, Avios, used by British Airways and Qatar Airways. On July 7th, the IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card officially debuted.
The IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card stands out for its unique approach. Instead of being tied to a single airline, it functions as a multi-brand frequent flyer credit card. Cardholders can select Qatar Airways Privilege Club or British Airways Executive Club as their preferred airline loyalty program. This lets you earn points directly within your partner’s frequent flyer program.
While the distinction might seem minimal—given that Avios can be transferred freely between Qatar Airways Privilege Club and British Airways Executive Club—the real value lies in the differences offered through the welcome bonus. Let’s delve into some key details of the card.

## **Charges and Welcome Benefits**
Joining Fees| ₹40,000 + GST  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| **Qatar Variant** : Qatar Gold Membership Tier + 20,000 Avios**British Airways Variant** : 55,000 Avios  
Renewal Fees| ₹10,000 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| **Qatar Variant** : 5,000 Avios + Qatar Gold (3L Spend on Qatar Airways Website or mobile App)**British Airways Variant** : 10,000 Avios  
Renewal Fee Waiver Criteria| Not Applicable  
  * Choosing between the two programs comes down to your preferred welcome bonus. Unless you frequently fly One World Airlines and value Gold/Sapphire status, the 55,000 Avios from the BA Executive Club is better than the Qatar Privilege Club bonus.
  * *IndusInd cardholders must be passengers on bookings to qualify for the required spend. That said, I wish the spend requirement for Gold tier renewal on the Qatar variant weren’t restricted solely to spending on Qatar.


## **Reward Points Accrual**
Spends Area| Reward Rate  
---|---  
British Airways or Qatar Airways mobile app or the website.| 2 Avios per ₹200  
All Retail Spends*| 1 Avios per ₹200  
POS Spends at Prefered International Destination| 5 Avios per ₹200  
***** Except for Fuel.
  * Avios will be earned only for spends up to the assigned credit limit in every statement cycle and gets credited in 10 days after statement generation
  * You can select your preferred destination while applying to get the dual benefits of higher reward rates and a lower forex markup of just 1.5%
  * While you earn 5X Avios on in-store purchases, online transactions made at your chosen international location will only earn 1 Avios for every INR 200 spent
  * You can update your preferred international destination after the first year of your card membership. Please contact us at 1860 267 7777 or submit a written request to make changes.


### **Milestone Benefits**
Required Spends| Milestone Benefits| Total Points  
---|---|---  
8 Lakhs| 25,000 Avios| 25,000 Avios  
16 Lakhs| 25,000 Avios| 50,000 Avios  
## **TechnoFino Maximum**
A key factor in maximizing rewards with this card is achieving spending milestones. These milestones significantly boost the overall rewards rate. For instance, spending 16L on the British Airways (BA) variant could yield 113,000 Avios points. This includes 50,000 Avios from the milestone, 8,000 Avios from regular spending, and a 55,000 Avios welcome bonus on the BA Variant.
While Qatar Airways and British Airways are known for higher taxes on flights, this can also make it easier to find award availability compared to airlines with lower taxes.
## **Travel Benefits**
###  Airport Meet and Greet Service
  * 2 complimentary meet and greet services per card anniversary year


The IndusInd Bank Avios Credit Card offers a unique benefit: complimentary International Airport meet & greet services across the globe. This service is a rarity among Indian credit cards, providing a truly exclusive travel experience. With meet & greet, you enjoy expedited security and immigration processes, accompanied by airport staff and a porter. This service eliminates the hassle of navigating the airport alone, ensuring a smooth and comfortable journey.
To view the full list of airports where this feature is offered, please [click here](https://www.indusind.com/content/dam/indusind-corporate/Other/Airports-Terminals-Meet-Assist.pdf).
### Airport Lounge Access
Access Via – Credit Card**Complimentary Domestic Limit** – 8 Visits/Calendar year within India only for primary cardholder (Maximum 2/Qtr)Network – MasterCard/AMEX
Access Via – Priority Pass**Complimentary International Limit** – 8 Visits/Calendar year only for primary cardholder (Maximum 2/Qtr)
  * Priority Pass membership is valid only for the first 2 years which is really not done for a card worth ₹9999 per year that too without any renewal benefits.
  * If you exceed the 8 Complimentary visits, you will be charged US $27 + GST per visit. 


### International Travel Insurance
The IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card provides valuable overseas medical insurance coverage of up to USD 25,000 for both the primary cardholder and their spouse (if travelling together) during their international trips. This coverage is valid for up to 60 days per trip and is applicable only when the travel tickets are purchased using the IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card.
## **Other Benefits**
###  Fuel Surcharge Waiver
1% fuel surcharge waiver max up to ₹3000 per month.
### Forex Markup Charges
  * FCY Markup Fee: 3.50%+GST (1.50% + GST at preferred destinations)


## **TechnoFino Recommends**
The offering left me underwhelmed overall, primarily due to the steep annual fee, the low earning rate, and the restrictive tie to a single frequent flyer program—Avios—which is notorious for imposing high taxes and surcharges on passenger bookings. This combination fails to pique my interest. While the card may attract a niche audience enticed by Qatar and OneWorld Elite Status, it holds little appeal for the majority, especially when compared to the far more rewarding credit card options available in the market today. And let’s not overlook the dismal lounge access limits—this seriously needs a rethink, IndusInd!

I got this card as LTF. Now I have read somewhere that the benefits of the LTF version of this card are different from the paid version. Is that true?

This looks like a great option for frequent travelers! The ability to earn Avios points on everyday spending is definitely a plus. How does it compare to other travel cards in terms of redemption flexibility and partner airlines? Would love to hear real user experience

If you were to opt for the QR Privilege Club Gold Status would you then need 300 Qpoints to upgrade to Platinum status, or would you need to earn the full 600 Qpoints to reach the Platinum tier?
