Yes Bank Marquee is highly recommended since both the joining fees and the annual fees are well covered by the points being given against the fee. The USP of unlimited lounge access and an unbelievable reward rate for online and offline spending will disrupt the market for sure. Yes Bank should try to rope in some more transfer partners as well if it wants to make its reward points-based card portfolio successful.

A feature-wise comparable card to this can be the ICICI Bank Emeralde Private Metal which comes at a similar joining fee points but without any substantial joining benefits.
