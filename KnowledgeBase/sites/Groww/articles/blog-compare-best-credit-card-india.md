## **Factors To Consider Before Opting For A Credit Card**
There are a few factors that you should keep in mind before you apply for a credit card -
  * ### **Credit Score**


The credit score requirements vary depending on the type of card you're looking for. If you're looking for a card specifically for travel and shopping, the higher, the better—but if you don't have much of a history of using credit cards, it might be wise to start with the one that's easier to qualify for.
  * ### **Fees**


Fees can quickly add up—especially if you tend to carry a balance from month to month (which is common with cards like this). A high-interest rate can also make it more difficult to pay off your balance each month, so be sure to shop around when comparing rates. Be sure to check the fees associated with your chosen card.
Some cards offer cash-back rewards or other perks that come with annual fees or interest rates. Others charge an annual fee even if there are no other fees or interest rates attached to the account itself. You'll need to figure out what works best for you before signing up!
  * ### **Interest Rates**


Interest rates are typically higher, so make sure that's an important factor when choosing your card. Most cards offer an introductory period where there are no fees or interest charges for your first few months of use, but then this changes into a regular APR (annual percentage rate). These rates vary from 0% up to 27% depending on how long you've had the account and where you live.

## **How to Choose the Best Credit Card?**
Choosing the **best credit card** is no easy task; it requires careful consideration of these aspects before you go ahead. 
  * **Fees & Charges -** You should keep an eye on the joining fees of your credit card, along with the associated membership charges. Some cards, while offering benefits, may have high joining fees that you need to be aware of. 
  * **Credit Limit -** You should know the credit limit offered by any particular card and see whether it suits you. You should be able to apply for credit swiftly and repay [credit card EMIs](https://groww.in/calculators/credit-card-emi-calculator) conveniently across multiple tenures. 
  * **Card Value -** Analyze how much value you’ll get out of the credit card. The **best credit card** is one that will give you the reward points and bonuses that are suited to your specific lifestyle needs, while coming with lounge access, dining rewards, etc. 
  * **Your Specific Needs -** Of course, the biggest thing to evaluate before finalizing your decision is to list down your needs, i.e. online shopping, travel rewards, etc. Thereafter, find the card that meets most of these needs with easy criteria and reasonable fees/charges.

## **Risks of Opting For A Credit Card in India**
The risks of opting for a credit card in India are many. The biggest risk is credit card fraud, which is quite common in India. Your card could be compromised by hackers who use it to make fraudulent purchases or transfer money to other accounts. This can happen when you're using your card at a store that doesn't accept cards or online purchases, or if you use it without securing it with two-factor authentication.
Another risk is high-interest rates. If you don't pay off your balance on time each month, the interest rate will add up quickly and may turn into a fee if you don't pay it off within a year.
There are also some cards that offer benefits like travel insurance or roadside assistance, but those are often not worth the cost of using them.
## **Conclusion**
Having a great credit card that caters to your specific needs can be greatly beneficial. Compare the top credit cards before you decide on one. Credit cards are also a means to build your credit history. Credit scores are indicative of the likelihood of somebody being able to repay their debts. A good credit history improves your credit score which in turn increases the chances of your loan approval in the future. Hence, choosing the right credit card is important when it comes to managing your finances. Compare and choose from the best credit cards in India to make the most of its features, benefits and rewards!
