Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is a crucial element of the financial landscape in India. It is designed to regulate and generate revenue from the trading of securities and introduced to bring forth speculative trading and ensure a fair contribution to the economy from market participants. 
STT is imposed on the transaction value of securities traded on recognized stock exchanges. 
This tax applies to various financial instruments, including shares, derivatives, and equity-oriented mutual funds. Understanding how STT is levied provides valuable insights into its impact on investors, traders, and the broader financial market.
## **What is Securities Transaction Tax (STT)**
Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is a direct tax levied on the trading of securities in India. Introduced in 2004, STT aims to curb speculative trading and generate revenue from the financial markets. It is imposed on the transaction value of securities traded on recognized stock exchanges, including shares, derivatives, and equity-oriented mutual funds.
An example of STT is during an equity delivery transaction. You buy 100 shares from company ABC at Rs. 500 per share. It is a delivery-based equity transaction. The STT rate for this transaction is 0.1% on both the buy and sell sides.
On the buy side, the STT is Rs. 50, and on the sell side, the STT amount is Rs. 55.
## **Features of Securities Transaction Tax**
The primary features of STT are:
  * ### **Applicability**


This applies to the buying and selling of equity shares listed on recognized stock exchanges, and it also includes futures and options transactions in the equity segment. STT is levied on the sale of units of equity-oriented mutual funds when traded on the stock exchange.
  * ### **Varied Rates**


Rates of STT will vary based on the type of security and the nature of the transaction. 
  * ### **Automatic Collection**


STT is collected automatically by stock exchanges from brokers, who then collect it from traders. This ensures efficient and timely collection of the [tax](https://groww.in/p/tax).
  * ### **Revenue Generation**


It is a source of revenue for the government, contributing to the exchequer without placing a significant burden on investors, as it is a small percentage of the transaction value.
  * ### **Transparency**


The transparent and straightforward nature of STT simplifies compliance for traders and investors. It also reduces the potential for tax evasion compared to other forms of transaction taxes.
  * ### **Legality**


STT is governed by the Securities Transaction Tax Act, 2004. The act provides detailed guidelines on the imposition, collection, and administration of the tax.
## **Securities Liable for STT**
Here are some securities liable for STT:
  * Shares, bonds, [stocks](https://groww.in/stocks), scrips, debentures, or other marketable securities of an incorporated company or a body corporate 
  * Units or instruments in any other form issued by any collective investment scheme for its investors
  * Derivatives, for example, options and futures 
  * Equity-oriented mutual funds units
  * Any securitised debt instruments
  * Rights or interest in securities


In the case of futures and options, STT will be levied only on the sale side. Note that all market transactions do not come under the purview of STT. 
## **Understanding How is STT Levied**
STT is levied on selling or purchasing securities on listed stock exchanges. The government of India decides the rate of STT from time to time.
Listed stock exchanges or recognised entities in case of [mutual funds](https://groww.in/mutual-funds) or merchant bankers in case of [IPO](https://groww.in/ipo) are required to collect STT from investors and deposit the same with the government before the 7th of every month. 
Here are the different rates on transactions:
**Taxable Securities Transaction** |  **STT Rate** |  **Person Responsible for Paying STT** |  **Value on Which STT is Levied**  
---|---|---|---  
**Delivery-based purchase of equity share** |  0.1% |  Purchaser |  Price at which equity shares are purchased  
**Delivery-based sale of equity share** |  0.1% |  Seller |  Price at which equity is sold  
**Sale of units of mutual funds** |  0.001% |  Seller |  The selling price of the mutual fund units  
**Sale of equity share or a unit of an equity-oriented mutual fund when such contract is settled otherwise by actual delivery of unit or share** |  0.025% |  Seller |  Value of securities based on the volume-weighted average price  
**Sale of options in securities** |  0.1% |  Seller |  Value of options premium  
**Sale of options in securities where options are exercised** |  0.125% |  Purchaser |  The settlement price of a contract  
**Sale of futures in securities** |  0.02% |  Seller |  The trading price of futures  
**Sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to the Mutual Fund – ETFs** |  0.001% |  Seller |  Price at which unit is sold  
**Sale of unlisted shares under an offer for sale to the public included in IPO and where such shares are subsequently listed in stock exchanges** |  0.2% |  Seller |  Price at which such shares are sold*  
**Purchase of Units of Equity Oriented Mutual Funds** |  NIL |  Purchaser |  NA  
**_Note: As per the Union Budget 2024-_**
**_- it is proposed to increase the rates of STT on the sale of an option in securities from 0.0625% to 0.1% of the option premium_**
**_- on sale of futures in securities from 0.0125% to 0.02% of the price at which such futures are traded._**
## **When is Securities Transaction Tax Levied**
Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is levied at specific instances when transactions involving certain types of securities occur on recognized stock exchanges.
Some circumstances where STT is imposed:
  * STT is levied on both the buying and selling of equity shares when the transaction results in the actual delivery of shares. This means that when an investor buys shares and takes delivery or sells shares and delivers them, STT is applicable.
  * STT is levied only on the selling side in intraday transactions where the shares are bought and sold on the same trading day without any actual delivery.
  * STT is applicable on the selling side of futures contracts.
  * STT is levied on the selling side of options contracts when the option is exercised.
  * STT is levied on the sale of units of equity-oriented mutual funds when the transaction is conducted on a recognized [stock exchange](https://groww.in/p/stock-exchange).


## **STT on Physical Delivery of Derivatives**
All [F&O](https://groww.in/futures-and-options) contracts are physically settled. In this case, STT is levied on traders and is charged on the successful delivery of derivatives.
CBDT, the governing body, announced that all physical delivery of derivatives would be subject to 0.1% STT. These transactions are treated similar to equity share transactions and are taxed at the same rate.
## **STT and Its Connection with Income Tax**
All transactions of securities listed on stock exchanges are charged with STT. However, the treatment of STT [income tax](https://groww.in/p/tax/income-tax) purposes depends on the nature of the transaction.
All transactions on stock exchanges are based on two motivations— for trading/investing and to earn business income.
  * ### **Income from Investment/Trading**


All salaried or self-employed individuals carrying out the transaction of securities for financial gains are liable to pay STT. All gains from such transactions are called capital gains and are classified as LTCG or STCG, depending on the holding period. 
  * ### **Business Income**


Entities entering into securities transactions to generate business income are also liable to pay STT. However, one can claim the total STT paid as a deduction under Section 36 of the [IT Act](https://groww.in/p/tax/income-tax-act) while filing returns. STT, in this case, is considered a business expense and is liable for deduction.
## **Takeaway**
Understanding how Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is levied is essential for anyone participating in the financial markets. STT is a straightforward tax applied to specific transactions involving equity shares, derivatives, and equity-oriented mutual funds traded on recognized stock exchanges.
By being aware of the applicable rates and the nature of transactions subject to STT, you can accurately calculate transaction costs and also comply with the regulations.
