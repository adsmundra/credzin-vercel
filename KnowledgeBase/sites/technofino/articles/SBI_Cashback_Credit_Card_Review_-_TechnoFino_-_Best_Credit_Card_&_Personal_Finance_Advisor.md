SBI Cashback – an insanely rewarding and unbelievably simple no-nonsense credit card that has taken all credit card users by storm. After Axis, it seems like SBI Cards has taken the lead to bring good days for all the plastic money enthusiasts. No one would have ever believed that one day some bank would offer products better than HDFC Bank in the market. From here the competition is only going to get fiercer for the banks and better for consumers.
So let’s have a quick look at what this card offers!

## TechnoFino Recommends
This card is a delight for cashback lovers and I highly recommend it! All those who are worried about its fee should think that to break even you need to spend **just ₹23,600 in a year** and above that, all the cashback is nothing but your net gain if you don’t cross the **₹2** L mark!
Still, SBI Cashback can**replace all the cashback cards** like [ICICI Amazon Pay](https://www.technofino.in/icici-amazon-pay-credit-card-review/), [RBL Zomato Edition](https://www.technofino.in/rbl-bank-zomato-edition-classic-credit-card-review/), and [Standard Chartered Smart](https://www.technofino.in/standard-chartered-bank-smart-credit-card-review/) and even beats [Standard Chartered Ultimate](https://www.technofino.in/standard-chartered-ultimate-credit-card-review/) handsomely if you are a heavy **online-only spender and hardly use cards offline.** And if you get this one then why even keep paid cards like Axis Flipkart and [HDFC Millennia](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-millennia-credit-card-review/) in your portfolio? 
This card also gives a serious run for money to [BOB Eterna](https://www.technofino.in/bank-of-baroda-eterna-credit-card-review/) which is offered for a hefty fee of **₹2500 + GST** but be mindful that Eterna rewards wallet loads. So I would not recommend weeding out all the winning cards from your portfolio in haste since the reward rate of this card is not sustainable in the long run so replace only what you are confident of getting back in case a devaluation happens.
Initially, this card was grabbed by everyone with a lot of enthusiasm which has now fizzed out since SBI has announced that this card will not work in online sales where SBI cards are already running an instant discount offer. So keep this in mind before replacing this with the above cards from your portfolio.
Though this card doesn’t give accelerated rewards on **Utility Bill Payments** like **[Axis Ace](https://www.technofino.in/wp-admin/post.php?post=4321&action=edit)** but then you always have the option of routing those spend through any online platform which can help you mask the merchant. 😉

I applied at Rcity mall, mumbai. They can’t apply for this card yet. Remember, they are 3rd party salesmen working on behalf of SBI card. Asked him to process my application for Prime card. His phone app showed – ‘soft approval no docs required’. SBI card usually calls twice before applying, one from the local SBI office, and once again from their head office (gurgaon?) to confirm your application details. You can ask to change the card during the final call, and they’ll do it. Let’s ee

During the verification call of credit card approval, the executive said that 5% reward rate is not applicable on online utility bills payment, is that true? Because can’t find that anywhere in T&C. And I checked with the executive, LIC/Insurance premiums are counted in utility bills hence, won’t get 5% on LIC premium payments etc. Please do share any information if you have on this. Thank you.

MITC clearly says Utilities payments are defined and determined basis MCC categories communicated by Networks and include the following MCCs 4900, 9399, 4814, 5960 and 6300. Two of these MCCs are insurance so insurance will get only 1%

I applied for this card and it immediately got rejected the very next day. Not sure why this happened as I already hold another SBI credit card. Has anyone else also faced such issue?
P.S: I did not even got a call from any SBI representative to process my application. That’s strange.

As of now cashback is fast and shows as earned post billing. T+2 days.
And they are posting it 5% per transaction and rounding off to lower rupee.
