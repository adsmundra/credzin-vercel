The National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) is India’s largest exchange for agricultural commodities. The exchange is fully electronic and plays a crucial role in the agricultural market by facilitating the trading of derivative contracts for several agricultural commodities, such as wheat, cotton, and sugar.
The NCDEX trading platform is used by several parties, including farmers, traders, and investors. The exchange supports market participants and helps them manage risk. Further, it plays an important role in price discovery, settlement, and clearing processes. In this blog, we will take a closer look at the NCDEX and dive deeper into its features and role.
## **What is NCDEX?**
The National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, or the NCDEX, is India’s largest exchange for agricultural products and derivatives. The primary purpose of the exchange is to facilitate the electronic trading of agricultural derivative contracts like futures. The exchange mainly focuses on agricultural commodities like wheat, sugar, spices, and cotton.
Before transitioning to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the NCDEX was governed by the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952. At present, the NCDEX is managed by an independent board, with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) maintaining supervision and oversight of the exchange.
## **History & Evolution of NCDEX**
The NCDEX was established on April 23, 2003, and commenced operations on December 15, 2003. The founding members of the exchange include major financial institutions like the National Stock Exchange (NSE), ICICI Bank, CRISIL, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).
The NCDEX, a fully electronic and technology-driven exchange, has been playing a vital role in the growth of agricultural trading in India. Over the years, it has launched numerous products, aided in fair price discovery and helped effectively manage risk.
The NCDEX trading platform is used by multiple traders, farmers, and investors due to the variety of agricultural commodities that can be traded on the exchange, along with the various products that market participants can utilise. To further make the trading process efficient, the NCDEX introduced trading instruments like futures, options, and indices in the agricultural market of India.
Some of the key achievements of the NCDEX include:
  * Increasing the level of transparency in the agricultural trading market
  * Aiding farmers and traders in the fair price discovery of agricultural products
  * The prices of NCDEX are often used as global benchmarks
  * Being regulated, the NCDEX has created a secure environment along with fostering growth.


## **Commodities Traded on the NCDEX**
The commodities traded on the NCDEX can be divided into four primary categories:
  * Agricultural commodities: Wheat, maize, guar seed, guar gum, paddy, etc.
  * Spices: Coriander, cumin, turmeric, pepper, etc.
  * Pulses & oilseeds: Mustard seed, castor seed, chana, bajra, etc.
  * Other commodities: Cotton and sugar.


Guar seed, guar gum, and cottonseed oilcake are some of the most actively traded commodities on the NCDEX.
## **How NCDEX Works**
The NCDEX is an exchange for agricultural commodities and is important in connecting buyers and sellers of different agricultural products. The NCDEX enables market participants to buy and sell derivative contracts of various agricultural products.
Trading on the NCDEX is a streamlined process. Traders, farmers, or investors can place buy and sell orders through registered brokers. NCDEX offers instruments such as [futures and options (F&O)](https://groww.in/futures-and-options) by which one can trade various commodities. Here, the price discovery of a commodity is determined largely by supply and demand.
The National Commodity Clearing Limited (NCCL) clears and settles all deals executed on the NCDEX. The NCCL settles all trades executed on a net basis for daily settlements and on a gross basis for delivery settlements. The NCCL also provides its clearing members with financial compensation to make good losses in the case of a non-defaulting party or pay-in of funds or goods in the case of a defaulting party.

## **NCDEX Trading Instruments**
Commodities on the NCDEX can be traded via derivative instruments like futures and options. There are also indices that track the movement of commodity prices.
  * Futures contracts are the most commonly used instrument for trading agricultural commodities.
  * Options contracts are available for only select commodities.
  * The NCDEX index tracks the price movements of 10 agricultural commodities. The index tracks the spot prices of the commodities, giving equal weightage to each commodity.


The [spot price ](https://groww.in/p/spot-price)of a commodity refers to the current quote or the price at which one can take delivery of a commodity at the moment. A [commodity's futures](https://groww.in/p/what-is-commodity-futures) price signifies a commodity's estimated value in the future.
