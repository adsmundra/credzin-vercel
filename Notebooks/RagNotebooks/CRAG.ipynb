Netflix is all set to drop a documentary that football fans won’t want to miss. Regionally titled Baila, Vini, this new release dives deep into the life of one of football’s brightest stars - Vinicius Jr. Whether you’re a die-hard Real Madrid supporter or just love a good underdog story, this film has something for everyone. And yes, Vini Jr. officially premieres on Netflix on May 15.\\n\\nWhat’s Vini Jr. all about?\\n\\nVini Jr. follows the rise of Vinicius Jr., from his humble beginnings in Brazil to becoming a global football sensation and one of the key players for Real Madrid. The documentary captures emotional and career-defining moments, such as his early days in São Gonçalo, one of Rio de Janeiro’s toughest neighbourhoods and his discovery and training at Flamengo’s youth academy.\\n\\nThe film will also chronicle his breakthrough as a professional footballer and his move to Real Madrid, and winning the UEFA Champions League. You’ll not just see goals and celebrations, you’ll see what it took to get there. His doubts, his successes, and his journey from street soccer to one of the biggest stadiums in the world.\\n\\nWho’s in it? Big names, big moments\\n\\nThe documentary features several football legends who’ve seen Vini’s rise up close. Stars who have shared their insights, experiences, and support for him include Neymar Jr., Roberto Carlos, Toni Kroos, Karim Benzema, Jude Bellingham and Thibaut Courtois, among others.\\n\\nWho is Vinicius Jr.? A quick look at his journey\\n\\nVinicius José Paixão de Oliveira Júnior, better known as Vinicius Jr., was born on July 12, 2000, in São Gonçalo, Brazil. Growing up in a poor neighbourhood called Porto do Rosa, Vini’s dream was simple: play football and give his family a better life. He started training seriously when he was just 4 years old.\\n\\nBy 2010, he had joined Flamengo, one of Brazil’s biggest football clubs. Starting off as a defender, he soon shifted to forward, where his speed, skill, and flair stood out. By 16, he signed his first pro contract. And just a year later, he caught the eye of Real Madrid. In 2018, his dream went global as he officially joined the Spanish giants. Ever since then, there has been no looking back for Vini Jr.\\n\\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, as well as celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.',\n",

The internet called her out for trivialising what looked like a genuine moment of distress. Social media users slammed her for documenting and posting the incident instead of offering support.\\n\\n\"This is not nautanki. He is experiencing anxiety,\" a user said, while another user added, \"When you prioritise audience engagement over your own child’s vulnerability, you just lose as a parent.

Trust me, he needs it,\" another user added.\\n\\nSee the comments here:\\n\\nWhile Saloni Agarwal may have intended the video to be light-hearted, the internet saw it as a reminder that children\\'s emotions aren\\'t content.

The urine travels to a tank in her basement, which is pumped out a couple of times each year by a lorry that visits Williams and others in her area that take part in the project. \"It\\'s a nice change not dealing with the messy business of it. Making it easy for people is a biggie,\" Williams says.\\n\\nAvoiding mess is also likely to help tackle the \"ick factor\" when it comes to peecycling, says Williams. \"It\\'s icky and it\\'s smelly and it\\'s something we don\\'t talk about,\" she says. But while some may be put off by the idea of dealing with their own waste, REI\\'s research suggests that the ick factor doesn\\'t dominate people\\'s reactions to peecycling. People tend to be open to the idea, Shupack says, but to think that others wouldn\\'t be. \"It\\'s this assumption that everyone else is going to think it\\'s really gross. That initial ick factor is not as big of a deal as people assume it\\'s going to be,\" says Shupack.\\n\\nMany people are, however, concerned about pharmaceutical content in the urine. \"It\\'s the biggest question we get,\" Shupack says. REI has conducted research to find out just how much of common drugs like caffeine and the painkiller acetaminophen are evident in vegetables grown using urine fertiliser. The final results are yet to be released, but the preliminary findings suggest the amount of pharmaceuticals in vegetables fertilised with urine to be \"extremely small\". \"You\\'d have to eat a pretty obscene amount of lettuce, every day, for way longer than you can live\" to get a cup of coffee\\'s worth of caffeine, Shupack says.\\n\\nHealth worries and messiness aside, Williams points out that it is our Western attitude to waste that most urgently needs to change. \"Particularly in [the US], people don\\'t really think about where their waste goes. They think about it in terms of recycling and trash to some degree, but not so much in terms of human waste. It\\'s a new frontier for people.\"\\n\\nClimate change and water pollution can feel like impossibly big issues, but Williams doesn\\'t let them overwhelm her. Instead, she focuses on what she can do in a small way, in her own home. \"We can just do our part,\" she says. \"We aren\\'t perfect, but we try to at least be responsible in terms of what happens to our bodily waste.\"\\n\\n--\\n\\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.',\n",

And yes, Vini Jr. officially premieres on Netflix on May 15.\\n\\nWhat’s Vini Jr. all about?\\n\\nVini Jr. follows the rise of Vinicius Jr., from his humble beginnings in Brazil to becoming a global football sensation and one of the key players for Real Madrid. The documentary captures emotional and career-defining moments, such as his early days in São Gonçalo, one of Rio de Janeiro’s toughest neighbourhoods and his discovery and training at Flamengo’s youth academy.\\n\\nThe film will also chronicle his breakthrough as a professional footballer and his move to Real Madrid, and winning the UEFA Champions League.

He started training seriously when he was just 4 years old.\\n\\nBy 2010, he had joined Flamengo, one of Brazil’s biggest football clubs. Starting off as a defender, he soon shifted to forward, where his speed, skill, and flair stood out. By 16, he signed his first pro contract. And just a year later, he caught the eye of Real Madrid. In 2018, his dream went global as he officially joined the Spanish giants.

The urine travels to a tank in her basement, which is pumped out a couple of times each year by a lorry that visits Williams and others in her area that take part in the project. \"It\\'s a nice change not dealing with the messy business of it. Making it easy for people is a biggie,\" Williams says.\\n\\nAvoiding mess is also likely to help tackle the \"ick factor\" when it comes to peecycling, says Williams. \"It\\'s icky and it\\'s smelly and it\\'s something we don\\'t talk about,\" she says. But while some may be put off by the idea of dealing with their own waste, REI\\'s research suggests that the ick factor doesn\\'t dominate people\\'s reactions to peecycling. People tend to be open to the idea, Shupack says, but to think that others wouldn\\'t be. \"It\\'s this assumption that everyone else is going to think it\\'s really gross. That initial ick factor is not as big of a deal as people assume it\\'s going to be,\" says Shupack.\\n\\nMany people are, however, concerned about pharmaceutical content in the urine. \"It\\'s the biggest question we get,\" Shupack says. REI has conducted research to find out just how much of common drugs like caffeine and the painkiller acetaminophen are evident in vegetables grown using urine fertiliser. The final results are yet to be released, but the preliminary findings suggest the amount of pharmaceuticals in vegetables fertilised with urine to be \"extremely small\". \"You\\'d have to eat a pretty obscene amount of lettuce, every day, for way longer than you can live\" to get a cup of coffee\\'s worth of caffeine, Shupack says.\\n\\nHealth worries and messiness aside, Williams points out that it is our Western attitude to waste that most urgently needs to change. \"Particularly in [the US], people don\\'t really think about where their waste goes. They think about it in terms of recycling and trash to some degree, but not so much in terms of human waste. It\\'s a new frontier for people.\"\\n\\nClimate change and water pollution can feel like impossibly big issues, but Williams doesn\\'t let them overwhelm her. Instead, she focuses on what she can do in a small way, in her own home. \"We can just do our part,\" she says. \"We aren\\'t perfect, but we try to at least be responsible in terms of what happens to our bodily waste.\"\\n\\n--\\n\\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.',\n",
