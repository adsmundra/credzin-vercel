# Axis Bank Flipkart Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-flipkart-credit-card-review

Axis Bank Flipkart credit card was launched back in 2019 when the cobranded card space was evolving. I have held this card since then until last year after which I had closed this card to make space for other cards from Axis Bank’s stable. I got this as an upgrade from the erstwhile Axis Buzz credit card which has similar benefits. This card is quite popular among cashback enthusiasts.

Here’s a quick review of the same!

If you are a heavy spender on Flipkart and other preferred partners and want to have a card for offline spending as well then Axis Bank Flipkart Card is just the right one. The 5% unlimited cashback benefit on Flipkart purchases and an unlimited 1.5% cashback on all the spends make this card shine.

This one card when used for all your spending will give you quite a good value if you cross the yearly spending requirements. Its direct competitors areSBI CashbackandHDFC Millenniabut they only give better reward rates on online spends only.
