The recently launched HDFC Swiggy Credit card makes it the first cobrand card for the food cum instant grocery delivery giant. This card is surely going to delight a lot of foodies.

Here’s a short review of its benefits!

As you can see the joining fee is being compensated with a 3 months Swiggy One Membership which I would say is not clever on their part. The card could have been priced a bit higher and provided with a Swiggy One membership as long as the card is active.

HDFC strangely haven’t clearly stated the name of the merchants eligible for the 5% cashback and will not give the customers confidence in doing any spending on that category.

Spending ₹15,000 on the Swiggy portal will maximize your savings of ₹1,500 per month. The online spending cashback capping gets breached at ₹30,000 per statement cycle.

I have never written such a short review on TechnoFino for any other card. Surprised to see a card with no milestone benefits, lounge access and even a fuel surcharge waiver. Also, The joining fee is also not well compensated here. I would say, that the Swiggy HDFC card is really made for Swiggy-holics, since with no other visible benefits grab it only if you spend a lot on Swiggy.

The good thing about this card is that it will come on the MasterCard World platform and will provide theassociated perksand even current HDFC card holders can apply for this card. Also, a 10% discount on Swiggy Instamart with no exclusions items is also a worthy thing to note. Still, the product looks sustainable in the long run, unlike the RBL-Zomato debacle.

A much more versatile card which gives direct cashback and competition to this card is theAxis Airtel. The Card will be available for application in Swiggy App in the next 10 days.
