##### ** _(The stocks mentioned in the blog are as per Analyst Ratings and Market Capitalization)_**
The green hydrogen energy stock industry of India is aiming to achieve energy independence by 2047 and reach net zero emissions by 2070. To meet these ambitious targets, India is increasingly embracing green hydrogen energy.
This eco-friendly and sustainable fuel source is expected to play a crucial role in reshaping India's energy landscape. In this blog, you will learn about the best green hydrogen stocks in India, which are contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable future. 
## **Green Hydrogen Industry in India - A Brief Overview**
The green hydrogen sector in India is rising as the country aims for energy independence in the next couple of years. Green hydrogen is produced via electrolysis, where renewable energy such as solar and wind power is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This creates a clean fuel that can replace fossil fuels, reducing pollution.
The demand for green hydrogen is growing fast as it has the potential to decarbonise sectors including transportation, shipping, and steel production. It can replace traditional fuels in vehicles and industry, and serve as a backup for renewable energy sources. With its various uses, green hydrogen can power vehicles, heat buildings, and make chemicals and fertilisers.
India launched a National Green Hydrogen Mission in 2022 and set a target of 5MMT production capacity of green hydrogen annually with an additional renewable energy capacity of around 125 GW. Moreover, the Union Budget of FY 2024-25 has allocated a budget of ₹600 crore, leading to a 102% increase from the previous budget of ₹297 crore.
