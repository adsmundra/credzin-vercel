According to the Asian Development Bank, the Indian economy is expected to grow by approximately 8% in the next 5-6 years, endorsed by increasing public investment in infrastructure and a pickup in private sector investment.
Investors, motivated by the results of their investments in the past fiscal year, are prepared to devote a significant gear percentage of their savings to capital instruments in the forthcoming years. They are also motivated to invest in the **growing industries in India**.
Numerous experts speculate that the Indian Stock Market will also have progressed and expanded to the fifth largest in the world, accounting for the highest market capitalization. The market grows with various stepping elements supporting this expansion, such as government initiatives, foreign relations, market dynamics, etc.
Read further about **which sector will turn in India** and which **sectors in India** will flourish even more in the investing shortly future.
## **List of the Top Sectors in India that are Most Likely to Provide Excellent Returns**
The following sectors are likely to perform exceptionally well in the next couple of years-
### **1. Healthcare and Insurance Sector**
Due to an ageing population, an increase in chronic illnesses, and a growth in disposable income, India's demand for healthcare services is on the rise. In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic has also brought attention to the need for improved healthcare services and infrastructure in India, encouraging further investment.
Ayushman Bharat, a program that intends to offer health insurance to more than 100 million people, is one of several efforts the Indian government has made to improve the healthcare industry. Also, the government has raised the healthcare budget, creating investment opportunities and better healthcare services.
In India, the healthcare industry embraces cutting-edge technology like telemedicine, electronic medical records, and digital health platforms, giving the industry's businesses new development potential.
In India, the penetration of the health insurance market has significantly increased in recent years as more people purchase health insurance coverage. Moreover, with more insurance providers joining the market, there will likely be more competition and more products in the future, continuing this trend.
Nevertheless, India's healthcare and insurance industries provide promising prospects for expansion and advancement in the years to come. Businesses in these industries may use the increased demand for healthcare products and services, government efforts, technology improvements, and increasing health insurance penetration to expand their market share and open up new business possibilities.
Following are some of the companies worth considering in this sector-
  * [Sun Pharmaceutical Industries](https://groww.in/stocks/sun-pharmaceutical-industries-ltd)


  * [Divi's Laboratories](https://groww.in/stocks/divis-laboratories-ltd)


  * [Dr Reddy's Laboratories](https://groww.in/stocks/dr-reddys-laboratories-ltd)


  * [Cipla](https://groww.in/stocks/cipla-ltd)
  * [Apollo Hospitals Enterprise](https://groww.in/stocks/apollo-hospitals-enterprise-ltd)


### **2.****Renewable Energy Sector**
By 2030, India wants to have 450 GW of renewable energy capacity, comprising 5 GW of small hydropower, 10 GW of biofuels, 280 GW of solar power, and 140 GW of wind power. With India's renewable energy industry expanding quickly in recent years, the nation has made tremendous progress toward meeting this objective.
The building of ultra-mega solar parks and deploying solar rooftop programs are only two of the steps the Indian government has started to promote the use of solar energy. In addition, the construction of offshore wind energy projects is one of several measures the government has begun to encourage wind energy usage.
The Indian government is supporting the use of additional renewable energy sources, such as bioenergy and small hydropower, in addition to solar and wind power. The nation has considerable potential for bioenergy, with an estimated 25 GW potential from only agricultural waste.
Nevertheless, India's renewable energy industry is anticipated to continue to expand quickly in the coming years because of favourable government policies, falling costs for renewable energy technology, and rising demand for clean energy.
Following are some of the companies worth considering in this sector in India:
  * [Reliance Industries](https://groww.in/stocks/reliance-industries-ltd)


  * [Oil & Natural Gas Corporation](https://groww.in/stocks/oil-natural-gas-corporation-ltd)


  * [NTPC](https://groww.in/stocks/ntpc-ltd)


  * [Open Grid Corp](https://groww.in/stocks/power-grid-corporation-of-india-ltd)


  * [Adani Green Energy](https://groww.in/stocks/adani-green-energy-ltd)


### **3. IT Sector**
India has long been a significant player in the global IT sector because of its abundant supply of highly qualified workers and hospitable business climate. As a result, the nation's IT market has been expanding quickly, and by 2025, sales are anticipated to exceed $300 billion.
Several international corporations outsource their IT projects to Indian businesses, which are significant software development and maintenance service providers.
The IT industry in India has recently shifted towards more modern technologies like cloud computing, AI, and the Internet of Things. The government has started several programs to encourage the development of these technologies in the nation, and several Indian IT companies are making significant investments in these fields.
The Digital India program, which seeks to offer broadband connection to all residents and encourage the use of digital technology in the nation, is one of the efforts the Indian government has made to assist the expansion of the IT sector.
Overall, favourable government regulations, a sizable pool of qualified workers, and rising demand for digital technology are projected to fuel India's IT sector's continued strong growth in the years to come. Yet, the industry may encounter difficulties, including a skill gap, increased labour prices, and heightened international rivalry.
Following are some of the companies worth considering in this sector:
  * [Reliance Industries](https://groww.in/stocks/reliance-industries-ltd)


  * [Tata Consultancy Services](https://groww.in/stocks/tata-consultancy-services-ltd)


  * [Infosys](https://groww.in/stocks/infosys-ltd)


  * [HCL Technologies](https://groww.in/stocks/hcl-technologies-ltd)


  * [Wipro](https://groww.in/stocks/wipro-ltd)


### **4.****Real Estate Sector**
With several legislative reforms and changes in the regulatory environment, India's real estate market has recently undergone a period of transformation and consolidation.
As a result, the industry has been dealing with difficulties like a decrease in demand, problems with financing, and delays in project completion.
Yet, the Affordable Housing Program and the Real Estate Regulatory Authority are only two of the government's recent attempts to support the expansion of the real estate industry (RERA).
These programs aim to increase openness and accountability in the housing industry and provide affordable homes to society's middle- and low-income sectors.
In addition, it is anticipated that the Indian real estate market would gain from the country's expanding urban population and rising commercial real estate demand. Furthermore, India's office space market is anticipated to proliferate due to increasing demand from the business process outsourcing (BPO) and information technology (IT) industries.
As the government's attempts to support affordable housing and enhance the regulatory environment take effect, India's residential real estate market is also anticipated to revive in the coming years. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on affordable housing are among the government's initiatives to strengthen the real estate market.
Overall, it is anticipated that the Indian real estate industry will continue to confront obstacles shortly, but the sector's long-term prospects are still promising. Favourable government policies, growing urbanization, and commercial real estate market expansion are all anticipated to be positive factors for the industry.
Following are some of the companies worth considering in this sector-
  1. [Indiabulls Real Estate](https://groww.in/stocks/indiabulls-real-estate-ltd)
  2. [Oberoi Realty](https://groww.in/stocks/oberoi-realty-ltd)


### **5. Fast-Moving Consumer-Goods Sector (FMCG)**
Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) have seen significant growth in India over the past several years due to reasons including rising earnings, shifting lifestyles, and increased urbanization. The industry offers goods, including packaged food and drinks, toiletries, and cleaning supplies.
The growing demand for healthy and organic products is one of the significant trends in the Indian FMCG industry. As consumers' awareness of their health increases, they look for natural, organic, and chemical-free products.
By introducing new goods and spending money on research & development in this field, several FMCG firms in India are responding to this trend.
The growing emphasis on e-commerce and digital marketing in the Indian FMCG industry is another trend. Several FMCG firms are investing in e-commerce platforms and digital marketing due to the rise of online shopping to contact customers directly.
The Make in India program, which aims to promote manufacturing in the nation, and the National Food Processing Policy, which seeks to increase food processing and decrease food waste, are just two initiatives the Indian government has launched to support the growth of the FMCG sector.
The FMCG industry in India is anticipated to develop quickly over the next several years due to increased consumer demand, rising incomes, and supportive governmental regulations. Nonetheless, the industry may encounter difficulties, including escalating rivalry, growing raw material costs, and shifting customer tastes.
Following are some of the companies worth considering in this sector-
  * [Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL)](https://groww.in/stocks/hindustan-unilever-ltd)


  * [ITC Limited](https://groww.in/stocks/itc-ltd)


  * [Nestle India](https://groww.in/stocks/nestle-india-ltd)


  * [Britannia Industries](https://groww.in/stocks/britannia-industries-ltd)


  * [Godrej Consumer Products](https://groww.in/stocks/godrej-consumer-products-ltd)


### **6. Automobile Sector**
With a 7% share of India's GDP and millions of workers, the car industry substantially contributes to the nation's economy. Manufacturers of passenger automobiles, commercial vehicles, two-wheelers, and three-wheelers are included in this industry.
The Indian automotive industry has faced several difficulties recently, including decreased demand, regulation changes, and a move toward electric vehicles.
Yet, the industry is anticipated to rebound in the coming years, propelled by growing incomes, accelerating urbanization, and infrastructural growth.
The Faster Adoption and Manufacture of Electric Vehicles (FAME) plan, one of the numerous initiatives the Indian government has announced to help expand the automotive industry, intends to encourage the use of electric cars nationwide.
In addition, the government has also launched several other initiatives to support the manufacturing industry, including the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) program.
Favourable government policies, rising incomes, and growing customer demand will likely fuel the Indian car industry's growth over the next few years. Yet, the industry may encounter difficulties, including increasing fuel costs, shifting customer tastes, and escalating international rivalry.
Following are some of the companies worth considering in this sector:
  1. [Maruti Suzuki India Ltd](https://groww.in/stocks/maruti-suzuki-india-ltd)
  2. [Eicher Motors Ltd](https://groww.in/stocks/eicher-motors-ltd)
  3. [Automotive Axles Ltd](https://groww.in/stocks/automotive-axles-ltd)
  4. [Munjal Showa Ltd](https://groww.in/stocks/munjal-showa-ltd)
  5. [Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd](https://groww.in/stocks/motherson-sumi-systems-ltd)
  6. [Endurance Technologies Ltd](https://groww.in/stocks/endurance-technologies-ltd)
  7. [Jamna Auto Industries Ltd](https://groww.in/stocks/jamna-auto-industries-ltd)


## **Conclusion**
It makes sense for an intelligent investor to invest in India’s growing sectors for long-term investments. However, there is an important lesson to be learned here: not every growing industry will provide incredible returns. Therefore, diversifying is the best approach to selecting the best sectors in India for investment.
Allocate funds to various sectors that you believe will grow, reducing risk and ends so that you do not miss out on any booming sectors.
