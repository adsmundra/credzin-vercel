## **TechnoFino Recommends**
The **HDFC BizBlack Credit Card** isn’t just another business card—it’s a game-changer for entrepreneurs and professionals who want to **maximize their savings** while enjoying premium perks. With its generous **5X rewards program** , you can earn up to **16.5% back** on most business expenses. If your monthly spending hits **₹50,000** , that adds up to a whopping **₹1 lakh in savings annually** —money that can be reinvested into your business.
But it’s not just about savings. The BizBlack Credit Card goes beyond rewards, offering airport lounge access, golf privileges, and milestone benefits to make both work and leisure more enjoyable. Whether you’re flying for meetings or unwinding on the greens, this card ensures you do it in style.
HDFC Bank has a history of surprising its customers with unbeatable offers, like the legendary SmartBuy 10X rewards program, which was a massive hit for nearly five years. Now, with 5X rewards on business spends, the bank is once again proving its commitment to supporting business owners with powerful financial tools.
A similar program for corporate liability cards would be a great next step, but for now, BizBlack cardholders can sit back, earn big, and enjoy a seamless financial experience tailored to their needs.

Incorrect details as the International Lounge Access on Biz Black card is through the card itself and not with Priority Pass. If you run a website on credit cards, the least you can do is do better research. This detail is clearly mentioned on the card page on HDFC website.

Lol…learn to accept your mistake and make corrections where required. Not everything has to be a debate. HDFC BIZBLACK doesn’t have a priority pass and access is based on card itself.

Hi Bhavya,
I have two Biz Black cards for me and my brother but I am confused about the 5x rewards for the electricity bill bcoz I didn’t receive any 5x rewards in the last month for my bill payment.

For 5X activation, above 50K is required, this spend can be on any category or just on Utility spends?

Are you sure they dont allow municipal tax payment for 5x rewards? If not, they will still be counted towards 1x rewards and milestone right?
