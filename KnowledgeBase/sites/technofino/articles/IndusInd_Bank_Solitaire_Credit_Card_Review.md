Source: https://www.technofino.in/indusind-bank-solitaire-credit-card-review

IndusInd Bank has recently launched a card named Solitaire Credit Card in metal form factor loaded with some luxury travel benefits. This card is loaded with a good number of lounge access for both domestic and international airports plus this also gives access to memberships of two of the luxurious hotel chains in India.

Let’s check the benefits of this card and see whether it justifies its fees or not.

IndusInd bank has kept this card in a very high price range but without any tangible joining benefits this card lacks a punch. Even for renewal fees paid, there is no value back.

Experience the luxury of a complimentary Taj Epicure Preferred Membership for one year which comes with:

Night Stay:Get one voucher for 1 Night Stay with breakfast for two persons​Upgrade Vouchers:2 Vouchers for a one-level room upgrade for one night reserved directly at the Best Available Rate​Set Meals:Get two vouchers at All Day Dining Restaurants for two people​Complimentary Spa Treatments: Complimentary one-time 60-minute spa treatment and access to sauna and steam for one person​Year-round discounts:Get up to 25% discount on your stay, dine-in, takeaway and Spa treatments​More details about Taj Epicure Preferred Membership arehere.

1% waiver for transactions between ₹400 to ₹4000. Maximum surcharge waiver of ₹500 per statement cycle.

Zero Forex Markup charges are applicable on international transactions.

At the time of joining, you are getting more than enough benefits to offset the joining fees, but this card seriously lags in terms of the reward system. I mean, look at its value-back percentage; it’s lower than any entry-level credit card. When you are paying a 30,000 joining fee and a 10,000 annual fee every year, then you should get enough value back to justify the fees, but this card offers nothing more than zero markup fees and a large number of complimentary lounge access.

If you are looking at the hotel memberships then there are better cards available if you want aTajEpicure membership. Hence I would say that this card is not a value-for-money credit card. IndusInd should work more on bringing some good transfer partners like it tried to do with it’s IndusInd Bank Avios Credit Card.
