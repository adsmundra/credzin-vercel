Investing in shares is an exciting prospect as it allows you to participate in the growth story of a company. When a company launches shares via an Initial Public Offering (IPO), many investors try to assess the potential it holds. This usually involves assessing the company’s business, competition, financials, etc. To successfully make this assessment, investors need detailed information about the company. 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has mandated all companies launching an IPO to share certain information about their business, financials, risks, etc., via a document called the Red Herring Prospectus or RHP.
In this article, we will share pointers to help you read an RHP efficiently and make an informed decision about investing in the company.
## **Things To Look Out For In A Red Herring Prospectus**
### **01: Industry and Business Overview**
As an investor, you might not be aware of all industries. The Industry Overview section of the RHP offers a macroeconomic view of the Indian economy that includes the GDP growth and consumption patterns in the economy.
It also offers an industry-specific view of the favourable demographics, growth drivers, opportunities, challenges, and macro & micro-level analysis of the industry and its sub-segments. This is a highly detailed section and offers a bird’s eye view of the industry to which the company belongs.
After explaining the industry dynamics, the RHP also offers a detailed view of the issuing company and its business operations. It typically lists the range of products and services offered by it, its size of operations, and the principles that drive its business.
### **02: Strengths**
The Red Herring Prospectus also lists the strengths of the company – both internal and external. These strengths differentiate the company from its competitors. It is important to go through this section only after understanding the company’s business and its competition.
The strengths of the company can help you understand the potential it has to grow in the near future.
### **03: Strategies**

  * Websites of Stock Exchanges and select Merchant Bankers 


Further, the issuing company is required to make a public announcement through at least one newspaper after submitting the RHP to SEBI. It can be a Hindi, English, or Regional language newspaper.
## **What is a Draft Red Herring Prospectus?**
A Draft Red Herring Prospectus or DRHP is the draft prospectus of the IPO.SEBI goes through the DRHP and recommends changes (if any) and/or approves it. Post-approval, the DRHP becomes an RHP.
## **Terms You Need To Know When Reading An RHP**
Let’s understand some basic concepts to understand the relevance of a Red Herring Prospectus or RHP.
  * ### **Offer Document**


It is a document that contains all the relevant information about the company, promoters, projects, financial details, objects of raising the money, terms of the issue, etc. It is called “Prospectus” in case of a public issue and “Letter of Offer” in case of a rights issue.
  * ### **Book Built Issue**


The IPO can be classified into two types based on pricing:
  * **Fixed Price Issue** – Where the issue price of the shares offered in the IPO is predetermined by the company and specified in the Offer Document.
  * **Book Built Issue** – Where the issue price is discovered on the basis of demand received from prospective investors at various price levels.


With these three concepts clear, let’s look at the definition of an RHP:
**_Red herring prospectus is an offer document used in case of a book-built public issue. It contains all the relevant details except that of price or number of shares being offered._**
## **Summing Up**
