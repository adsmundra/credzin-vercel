Aeroplan is the loyalty program of Air Canada, Canada’s flag carrier, and stands out as one of the most versatile airline mileage programs due to its partnership with over 50 airlines. Established in 1984 to reward frequent flyers, Aeroplan became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air Canada in 2002. Starting in 2003, Air Canada began selling off parts of Aeroplan, and by 2008, it had completely divested its stake to third parties. Aeroplan then started developing its in-house loyalty program but eventually reacquired Aeroplan, completing the acquisition in 2019. In 2020, Air Canada overhauled the Aeroplan program to enhance flexibility and member satisfaction. This revamp included eliminating fuel surcharges on award flights and introducing dynamic ticket pricing, which increased availability but with variable mileage costs.

Air Canada Aeroplan rewards frequent Air Canada and Star Alliance flyers with valuable perks such as seat upgrades, free check-in bags, and other benefits across five distinct status tiers.

As of 2023, Air Canada elite members can choose Select Benefit Bundles that offer additional rewards, such as bonus points, upgrade certificates, and lounge passes, with different options available at each status level.

Additionally, as you progress through the status tiers, you’ll earn eUpgrade certificates, which allow you to upgrade flights operated by Air Canada, Air Canada Express, and Air Canada Rouge from economy class to premium economy or business class.

To qualify for these tiers, you need to earn a certain number of status-qualifying miles (SQMs) or status-qualifying segments (SQSs), along with a minimum amount of status-qualifying dollars (SQDs). SQMs are based on your flight distance, SQSs on the number of flights you credit to Aeroplan, and SQDs on your ticket expenditure, calculated in Canadian dollars.

Let’s explore the extensive benefits and qualification criteria offered to each Aeroplan Elite Tier below:

Your status for the next year will be assessed based on your tier qualification by December 31st of the current calendar year.

Air Canada is a founding member of the Star Alliance, which allows you to earn and redeem Aeroplan points with any participating carrier. This extensive network includes over two dozen airlines worldwide, offering vast geographical coverage.

The following airlines are part of the Star Alliance:

In addition to these Star Alliance members, Aeroplan partners with a notable selection of non-alliance airlines. This allows you to earn redeemable Aeroplan points when flying with any of these partners. However, note that in some cases, you’ll only earn Aeroplan points on codeshare flights. Status Qualifying Miles (SQM) can be earned with select non-alliance partners, so check with the partner airline before booking if earning SQMs is important to you.

The following airlines are non-alliance Aeroplan partners:

Air Canada’s award earning is based on the distance flown, with additional consideration given to your fare class. For example, Economy Saver fares within Canada earn as little as 10% of the miles flown, whereas business-class fares can earn up to 150% of the miles flown. Additionally, individuals with Air Canada elite status are eligible for bonus points on Air Canada flights. The bonus points for each tier are as follows:

Earnings with partner airlines may vary, but generally, points are awarded as a percentage of the distance flown based on the fare class, similar to Air Canada’s flights. To check the specific earning rates for individual partners,click hereand select your preferred partner airline.

Air Canada Miles can be transferred from two major banking partners in India, namely Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. The transfer ratios are as follows:

While Air Canada offers an advantageous program, there is currently no co-branded credit card available in India for Air Canada.

You can transfer hotel loyalty program points to Aeroplan. While these conversions aren’t always the best value, they can help you save cash if you have plenty of points. Here are the transfer conditions:

Marriott Bonvoy:

Hilton Honors:

ALL – Accor Live Limitless:

Best Western Rewards:

Choice Privileges:

Coast Rewards:

IHG One Rewards:

Shangri-La Golden Circle Award:

Wyndham Rewards:

These options can provide flexibility and help maximize the value of your hotel loyalty points by converting them to Aeroplan points.

You can earn Aeroplan miles when shopping through Air Canada’s eStore. While many of the brands may not be particularly useful for Indians, there are several that offer valuable opportunities to maximize your miles:

One of the quickest ways to gain Air Canada miles is to buy them during promotional offers. While we usually recommend transferring points from your credit cards, buying points can be a very cost-effective option, especially given Air Canada’s minimal point requirements. You canclick hereto be redirected to the points purchase link.

Promotional offers often provide 80% to 100% bonus miles. For instance, if you buy the maximum amount of 250,000 points for about $6,300, you’ll receive a total of 500,000 points. This makes the cost per point approximately ₹1, but the value during redemption can be significantly higher. Additionally, you can maximize your benefits by using cards like Axis Reserve, which earns bonus points on international purchases. With a 5:2 transfer ratio, you could get about 31,200 more Air Canada Miles, so that’s 5,31,200 Air Canada Miles in total.

Air Canada boasts an extensive route network on its own, and its numerous alliance and non-alliance partners further expand this reach. Unlike United and other airlines, Air Canada maintains a standard award chart. It has eliminated fuel surcharges, so you’ll only need to pay minimal taxes plus a 39 Canadian dollar partner booking fee, if applicable. This is why Air Canada is favoured among loyalty program enthusiasts.

Aeroplan uses a hybrid distance and region-based award chart. Your payment is based on the flight length, but the pricing also varies depending on the region you fly to and from. These regions are very broadly defined. You can view the Air Canada Award Chart by clicking here.

Although Air Canada has removed some highly lucrative award redemptions, such as Etihad First Class to and from India, it still offers excellent international redemption options. Here are a few examples:

Infants under the age of two who aren’t occupying a seat (i.e., flying on an adult’s lap) can fly free on Aeroplan award tickets within Canada or between Canada and the U.S. For all other flights, they can travel at a discounted fare of 2,500 Aeroplan points or $25. This is an excellent deal compared to what other airlines charge for flying with an infant on points.

Additionally, Aeroplan allows you to add stopovers for only 5k Aeroplan miles, enabling you to plan cross-country vacations with minimal points. For instance, if you’re planning to fly to London, consider adding a stopover in Dubai. While Air India operates direct flights on the Delhi-London route, adding a destination can enhance your journey. The direct flight from DEL to LHR costs 60k Aeroplan miles, but for an additional 5k miles, you can fly with Gulf Air’s Business Class. This option allows you to experience two different Business Class cabins—A320neo and B787-9—as you’ll be transiting through Bahrain.

Up to eight family members can share a single pool of Air Canada Aeroplan points while maintaining separate accounts. The person who creates the pool is known as the Family Lead.

The Family Lead is responsible for setting each family member’s rewards and permissions upon inviting them to the pool. This ensures that, for example, children can earn points for the family without having the ability to redeem them.

Aeroplan points expire after 18 months of inactivity, meaning you must earn, redeem, donate, or convert points within that period to keep them active. The program will notify you 60 days before your points expire. Alternatively, if you hold elite status, your points do not expire as you are continually earning or redeeming points.

Aeroplan is a comprehensive rewards program that partners with dozens of airlines worldwide and hundreds of retailers, not just Air Canada. With its extensive network, Aeroplan is one of the top points programs globally for booking flights on a vast number of airlines. Additionally, it is one of the few programs that still publishes an award chart, detailing the points required for flights to specific regions, rather than using a dynamic pricing model based on demand.
