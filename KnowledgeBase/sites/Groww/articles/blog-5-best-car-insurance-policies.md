Owning a car is now more of a necessity than a status symbol in India in the 21st century. The possession of a car demonstrates your financial independence, places you in a higher class of peers, and gains you some much-needed favour with the family.
However, the pleasures of owning a car or any vehicle could be short-lived if, for example, your vehicle meets with an unfortunate and untimely accident, is stolen, is lost in a raging flood, or worse - if it proves to be the cause of an accident that results in the loss of life or property of a stranger. Anyone can experience these situations as disastrous, expensive, and frustrating!
There is one solution. Get a Car Insurance Plan.
This blog has compiled a list of the **Best Car Insurance Policies in India** in2025.
## **Car Insurance - A Brief Glimpse**
Car Insurance is an insurance policy that allows you to get the required financial coverage against several forms of damages, theft, harm caused to your vehicle, and third-party liability.
Motor insurance is a compulsory document that vehicle owners should carry while driving. It is essential in India to have motor insurance as per Indian law. Anyone who drives without an insurance policy has to pay heavy penalties.
To help you buy the right policy, here are the 5 **Best Car Insurance Policies** available in the Indian market right now.
## **Top 5 Car Insurance Policies of 2025**
**S.No.** |  **Best Car Insurance in India**  
---|---  
1. |  Bajaj Allianz Car Insurance  
2. |  ICICI Lombard Car Insurance  
3. |  Cholamandalam MS Car Insurance  
4. |  National Car Insurance  
5. |  Zuno General Insurance  
## **Factors to Consider While Choosing a Car Insurance**
Here are some important factors to note while selecting an insurance plan for car-
  * ### Market Research


Choosing the best car insurance option with so many options on the market can be challenging. Therefore, doing thorough research upfront becomes crucial. Then, you can choose the best plan with the best insurer through careful analysis. Then, ensure that your auto insurance offers comprehensive coverage at a reasonable price.
You are, additionally, choosing a reputable insurer with a good claim settlement ratio and an extensive network of garages. By doing this, you can easily use the cashless claim facility.
  * ### Fuel to be Used


You might have to pay a higher insurance premium if your car is a diesel. This is because diesel-powered vehicles are expensive, and so is their [IDV](https://groww.in/insurance/idv-in-motor-insurance). As a result, a car with a diesel engine will cost more to insure than one with a gasoline or compressed natural gas engine.
  * ### **Type of Coverage**


Your [car insurance](https://groww.in/insurance/car-insurance) costs will be significantly impacted by the coverage you select. However, don't sacrifice the types of coverage you require in favour of lower prices.
  * ### **Third-party Insurance**


According to the Indian Road Safety Act and the Indian Motor Vehicles Act, choosing a third-party insurance plan is required. Therefore, obtain third-party insurance before driving a vehicle you bought on the road. Usually, your dealer would offer it, and the premium costs would be added to the price of your car.
  * ### **Estimations and Quotes**


It's simple to accept a single estimate that appears to offer a fantastic premium and matching benefits, reasoning that there isn't anything better available. But this is a mistake that must be avoided at all costs. Consider, at the very least, obtaining three quotes from various trustworthy businesses.
## **Benefits Of Having a Car Insurance**
  1. With an adequate car [insurance](https://groww.in/insurance) policy, the insured will get coverage against loss or damage of the vehicle that is caused by accident, theft, fire, explosion, self-ignition, lightning, riots, strikes, acts of terrorism, transit by rail, road, air & elevator and natural calamities (Earthquake, Flood and more).


  1. It will also offer the required cover against all financial liability that causes injury or death of a third party or damage to the property. That provides benefits to survivors when an accident results in death.


  1. It covers lawsuits, including legal fees brought against you due to an accident.


  1. Having no claim bonus is one of the main benefits of having car insurance. A customer is qualified for this benefit each year without a claim. This could be offered as a discount on the premium, further lowering the insurance cost.


  1. Driving without a valid insurance policy is illegal and may result in steep fines. Therefore, you should purchase a **car insurance policy** to avoid this fine and adhere to the rules.
