When it comes to standalone restaurants or even chain restaurants which are not listed as any of the dining apps available in India there are cards which can offer you some good value-back. So if you frequent only such places then consider having a card from the list below.

EazyDineris a dine-out application created by a team that is extremely passionate about food, wine and all things fine. As a collective group of Chefs and Hoteliers who have worked in some of the best hotels and restaurants around the world, they are always on the lookout for new dining experiences and exciting cuisines. It is this love and passion for eating and exploring that brought them together to create EazyDiner.

The IndusInd Bank in conjunction with the EazyDiner offers instant discounts worth ₹3,000 on select luxury restaurants in India twice a year. This offer is valid only on a chosen few HNI cards of the bank.

EazyDiner has also partnered with Axis Bank to provide Dining Delights which entitles you to a premium dining experience on their HNI Cards, they provide you with a 40% instant discount up to ₹1,000. Other than this for your birthday you are eligible for a discount of 50% up to ₹3000 on dining out across specially curated restaurants using the above-mentioned Axis Bank credit cards.

Axis Bank has another offer for their other card holders which offers 25% off up to ₹800 on EazyDiner on paying via PayEazy.

EazyDiner also offers two cobranded credit cards with IndusInd Bank and I have extensively reviewed them before. Both the cards are highly recommended for frequent diners.

Other than the above offers there are more than 10 banks which provide instant discounts if you pay via the PayEazy feature of EazyDiner. Since the partnerships are mostly dynamic hence I am not listing them all here but do check them out!

Swiggy Dineout is another dining-out platform and has been a longtime partner with HDFC Bank for providing discounts when booking a table and eating out. Here I am listing some top cards if you use the app regularly.

This a newly launched co-branded card for Swiggy from HDFC Bank and is gaining popularity among card users.

Zomato Dining has no dedicated partnership when it comes to banking partners. You can either try to use any of the ongoing offers or pay using Zomato Vouchers bought using any of the multiplier portals.

For online food delivery, one can easily take advantage of certain cards which offer exceptional reward rates on online spending other than the cards which offer good reward rates on dining spending.

Other than the above-listed cards you can also bet on Axis Airtel/HSBC Cashback for 10% cashback, HDFC Millennia for 5%,Axis Acefor 4%, andAxis Flipkartfor 4% reward rate even forZomatoandSwiggy.

But if you are intoHotel Loyalty and Airmiles gamesthen buying Swiggy and Zomato vouchers from HDFC SmartBuy, AMEX Reward Multiplier and Axis Gift Edge type platforms would give you much better returns especially if you hold cards likeAmex Gold Charge, AMEX Platinum Charge,HDFC Infinia, HDFC Diners Club Black,Axis Reserve,Axis Magnusetc.
