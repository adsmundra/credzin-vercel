Axis Ace credit card is a darling of all cashback lovers with its best-in-class unlimited 2% cash back on offline spending and 5% on paying bills via Google Pay.

Here’s an updated review of its benefits amid all the devaluations!

This card is still a leader for offline spending since it offers 2% unlimited flat statement credit at such a low fee point. This credit card has one of the most clean statements I have ever seen regarding cashback calculations.

1% waiver for transactions between ₹400 to ₹4000. Maximum surcharge waiver of ₹500 per statement cycle.

Forex markup charges are applicable of 3.5%+GST.

Paying bills of ₹10,000 on the Google Pay app or using the card on select merchants ₹12,500 will maximize your savings of ₹500 per month. Rest the card can be used on all offline and online merchants for unlimited 2% cashback.

Amid all the devaluations this card still has some steam left especially the 2% unlimited cashback on offline spending. At such a low fee point, easy to achieve fee waiver, and reasonable cappings on a usually low rewarding category like bill payments this card is a showstopper as of now.Currently, the Axis Bank credit card is being issued only by Google Pay on an invite-only basis. You can also apply it on the Axis Bank mobile app if you have a pre-qualified offer. I had used this card quite extensively along with Axis Flipkart since its launch but got rid of them in 2023 when I started transitioning to travel credit cards. A word of caution for Apple users since GPay doesn’t support bill payments using a credit card on iOS.
