Hello everyone! I am back again with the Ultimate Guide of the audience’s favourite Domestic Frequent Flyer Program, Club Vistara. To all those miles enthusiasts, who prefer to travel in domestic sectors, Club Vistara is the frequent flyer program, you use if it serves that route. Vistara, the brand which was created by two of the greatest, TATA Group and Singapore Airlines, serves as a full-service carrier for Domestic and International travel. Their fleet includes Airbus A320, A321neo, Boeing 737-800NG, and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in its fleet and run A320 and A321neo on domestic routes, 737-800NG, and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on its international route. Vistara’s A321neo is the star of the show for domestic travel especially for its flatbed Business Class Seats.

With the current state of miles and points, it’s now really easy to experience it. From co-branded cards to point transfer partners, Vistara gives everyone a choice to experience its product.

Now let’s dive into the Frequent Flyer Program Vistara offers: Club Vistara. Let’s know the basics of Club Vistara and its tier benefits. Club Vistara has 4 tiers, let’s discuss the important benefits of the respective tiers:

You need to achieve 15,000 tier points and 4 flights to get to Silver Tier.

You need to achieve 25,000 tier points and 6 flights to get to Gold Tier

You need to achieve 35,000 tier points and 8 flights to get to Platinum Tier

For Club Vistara Gold and Platinum tiers, you can enjoy enhanced perks from Singapore Airlines if you’re flying with them. The perks are as below:

As you can see, Club Vistara offers great perks when you climb up the ladder in Elite Tiers. Elite Tiers used to be easier to climb earlier, just by flying a number of flights, but as now you need to complete revenue flights to earn Tier Points, it has become more challenging. Tier Points earning rate is the same as CV points earning according to which Elite Tier you belong. The chart is as below:

CV Points can be earned by taking revenue flights and the number of CV points you earn depends on the Elite Tier you belong to. You can earn as per the chart below:

With co-branded cards, one can get perks like getting direct access to CV Gold, different classes of tickets, upgrade vouchers, etc.

Club Vistara Points can be transferred from different banking partners as per below:

As we can see there are quite a few numbers of ways we can actually earn points but what’s the fun in earning if we can’t burn the points properly? Let’s see where you can burn your points.

Of course, this is the best possible way to burn the points. You can get the flights in way less cost-effective way when you burn your points to book the flights, and you end up paying the tax only. You can redeem both domestic and international sectors.

Though award booking is great to have, one needs to remember that there’ll always be limited availability of Award Seats, for example, an A320 will have 2 Business Class award seats and generally 4 in Premium Economy and 6 Economy award seats. Typically at max A321neo will be offering 3 Business Class award seats. Oh, wait, sometimes you may observe 4 as well on A321neo and 8 Economy award seats.

You can check the Club Vistara points requirement for each classhere. Alternatively, Vistara has anAward Calculator, where you can check the mileage requirements for your desired route.

The award flights booked using points can definitely be cancelled and rescheduled depending on the availability like any normal flights. As with any normal flight, it’ll also be coming with some charges, but here it’ll be with CV Points.

If you wish to cancel your booking, you need to give up 30% of the booking amount as CV Points. However, if you wish to reschedule, you need to give up 10% of the booking amount as CV Points.

You can upgrade your ticket with CV Points for both domestic and international sectors. This falls under subject to availability. Though upgrading is a great option you can only upgrade your revenue flights or the award seats booked using CV points, not the award flights booked using vouchers. For the CV points requirement to upgrade, please referhere. Alternatively, you can also check with the Upgrade Awards option with the award calculatorhere.

You can redeem CV points with partner airlines such as Air Canada, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, and Lufthansa. There are two major downsides to it. The first is, that the value is terribly low, and the second is it takes 14 working days just to book the flight. So even after this if you want to go with this option, you need to call Vistara Customer Care at +91 9289228888 and book your flight. The award redemption chart of partner airlines can be checkedhere.

Vistara does give the flexibility to book a flight using the cash + points option if you’re falling short of CV points. The value is relatively low here. It’d be wiser to purchase points and book rather than go with this option.

Club Vistara Points remain valid for 36 months from the date of acquisition, with the option to extend their validity by an additional 3 months through payment of a fee to Vistara. The extension is only possible when there are 3 months remaining before the points expire. Similar to many other frequent flyer programs, points cannot be earned, transferred, or used to prolong their validity. For Vistara, the expiration of points is determined based on their earning date.

With Vistara you can have 2 kinds of vouchers:

TheComplimentary Ticket Voucherswhich are earned by using their co-branded credit cards, can be used to book the desired seat category that the voucher provides but you have to pay other charges such as taxes, surcharges and other levies as applicable on the ticket at the time of booking. These vouchers are only applicable on a non-stop domestic ticket and share the same award quota as for the seats booked using CV points.

With theOne-Class Upgrade Voucher, you can upgrade to the next class category only if you booked a ticket using cash or CV points as per T&C. To upgrade award seats booked using vouchers, you need to pay in cash while checking in at the airport although some users have had luck even with their vouchers in this case. These vouchers are provided to you on your elite tier upgrade or renewal.

You can check all your vouchers by going to the “My Vouchers” section. For complimentary vouchers, go to “On-demand” vouchers and redeem them. If you get complimentary vouchers from Vistara for any compensation, you can redeem them from the “Redeem complimentary Voucher” section.

Though practically you can use a voucher in 9 months but don’t ever issue a voucher if you are not travelling within the next 3 months else you won’t be able to use it for your travel. For example, if you receive a voucher using yourAxis Vistara InfiniteCredit Card on 1st Jan 2023 and you intend to travel on 1st August 2023 and you issue the voucher of 1st Feb 2023 then you would have to use it with the travel date on or before 1st May 2023.

So for busy sectors like Delhi-Goa and Delhi-Mumbai always try to book award seats using CV Points else you won’t get any award seats 3 months before your travel date. Remember to book this by yourself else they will levy a service charge of ₹300 if you call customer care for this.

Vistara, a full-service carrier in India didn’t only excel in the Indian aviation industry but also introduced the best Frequent Flyer Program to reward its loyal flyers. They gave the option to travel with ultimate comfort and luxury. From their lie flat bed of the Business Class of A321neo to the delicious food served in Economy class, they took care of every kind of flyer. As the merger with Air India is going to happen very soon, and as promised by Air India we’ll be able to use the same benefits currently available, we can only expect this brand should exist separately.
