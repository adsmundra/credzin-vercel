Indian markets demonstrated resilience in moving between modest losses and gains. The Nifty 50 closed 41.35 points or (0.17%) lower at 24,812.05, while the BSE Sensex dipped 138.64 points or (0.17%) to close at 81,444.66. Auto and finance sector heavyweights drove the bounce back: IndusInd Bank was up 4.69% on a broker upgrade, and it was the key support. The rail index, which was trading at ₹137.83, along with the broader financials, with the Nifty Financial Services index at 15,084.24, also provided much-needed support. 
## **Global Pressures and Derivatives Dynamics**
Asian equity markets traded mixed, while European and US futures fell in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's policy decision. Middle East tensions, between Israel and Iran, sustained the risk-aversion mood, maintaining Brent crude prices high, inducing fear of inflationary pressure for oil-importing countries such as India.
Meanwhile, structural market changes made headlines. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) cleared a shift in equity derivatives expiry cycles: NSE contracts will expire on Tuesdays and BSE on Thursdays with effect from 1 September. The change, intended to enhance market efficiency, led to a steep drop in BSE's share price, lower by ₹2,632.60 with 1.19% , on concerns of losing volume and market share
## **Broader Market Trends & Leading Stocks**
Sector-wise, excluding autos and banks, midcaps were also subdued.The small-cap index declined to 53,033.80, down by 0.34%, while the mid-cap index also fell to 45,690.53 with 0.34%. Both indices hovered near the day's lows as markets traded cautiously.The cautious market sentiment was partly influenced by ongoing geopolitical tensions. However, Maruti Suzuki gained 1.23%, Mahindra & Mahindra rose 1.02%, HCL Technologies added 0.57%, Titan advanced 2.15%, Tech Mahindra edged up 0.39%, and Asian Paints increased 0.57%, standing out as the session’s notable gainers. Meanwhile, IT major TCS and consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever declined between 1% and 2%.
Volumes have been volatile with the shift in derivatives expiry and global uncertainty. The markets should stay range-bound between 24,800–25,000 on the Nifty unless new domestic or overseas triggers are forthcoming. The Fed announcement, crude price tail, and changing geopolitics would be the game-changers for market moves. Cautiousness is advised to investors with the priority for liquidity and being careful with stock selection with central bank signals hanging large over their heads.
The Nifty 50 is trading 65.96 points or (0.27%) lower at 24,785.35, while the BSE Sensex is trading 206.14 points (0.26%) lower at 81,367.73. Key sectors powering the rebound included auto stocks, with IndusInd Bank surging 4.67%. 
## **Global Cues & Market Drivers**
Markets remain cautious amid rising tensions in the Middle East, which continued to push Brent crude higher reinforcing inflation risks and keeping sentiment subdued globally. Asian equities were mixed, while European and US futures trended downwards ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement later today . Domestically, the market stabilised on the back of strong dip-buying by domestic institutional investors, with purchases totalling ₹82.07 billion marking a record 21st consecutive session of buying and helping offset foreign institutional outflows.

### **Top 5 Losers in the Market**
**Adani ports**
  * Opening Price: ₹1387
  * Current Price: ₹ 1374.80
  * Change: -1.26%


[Adani Ports ](https://groww.in/stocks/adani-ports-and-special-economic-zone-ltd)is trading lower today as heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and broader market volatility have dampened investor sentiment, leading to declines across several major stocks in the Indian market.

[Infosys](https://groww.in/stocks/infosys-ltd) is trading lower today, as persistent concerns about muted client demand and global market uncertainty weigh on investor sentiment, leading to selling pressure in the technology sector.
Domestic benchmark indices opened marginally higher on Wednesday despite heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. At 9:40 AM IST, the Nifty 50 was up 77 points (0.31%) at 24,930.95, while the Sensex gained 221 points, or 0.27%, to trade at 81,804.30.
Investor sentiment remains cautious following a fresh wave of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel. This marks the fifth consecutive day of cross-border hostilities, with reports suggesting that Israeli airstrikes may have targeted Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, a critical underground uranium enrichment site.
Brent crude surged over 4% overnight, reflecting concerns over potential supply disruptions. The spike in oil prices and risk-off global cues are likely to keep volatility elevated in the near term.
## **Global Risk-Off Mood Deepens as Middle East Tensions Escalate**
The continued air conflict between Iran and Israel entered its sixth day, with fears mounting over a potential escalation involving the U.S. President Donald Trump’s renewed hardline stance - calling for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” - added to market anxieties, pushing oil prices higher and prompting a global flight to safety. Brent crude spiked over 4%, while U.S. Treasuries and the dollar saw increased demand.
Asian markets reflected the sour mood. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index (ex-Japan) slipped 0.26%, while EUROSTOXX 50 futures dropped 0.4%. U.S. equity futures were flat after Wall Street closed lower overnight, weighed down by geopolitical concerns and economic uncertainty.
Adding to investor unease is the weak U.S. macro data. Retail sales in May fell by **0.9%** , the steepest decline in four months, stoking fears about consumer resilience. The Federal Reserve’s rate decision later tonight will be closely watched for policy cues, although most economists expect no change in the current interest rate.
## **Gold Eases on Profit Booking Ahead of Fed Decision; Rupee Hits Two-Month Low**
Gold prices edged lower in early trade on Wednesday as traders booked profits ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy announcement later tonight. This came even as escalating tensions between Israel and Iran continued to lend broader support to safe-haven assets.
At 9:40 AM IST, MCX Gold August futures were down 0.16% at ₹99,385 per 10 grams, after having closed at ₹99,541 in the previous session - a 0.40% gain, largely driven by geopolitical jitters. Analysts note that the safe-haven appeal of gold remains intact, but expectations of the Fed keeping rates steady, weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales, and subdued Chinese demand are capping further upside.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee weakened for the fourth straight session, sliding 13 paise to 86.37 against the U.S. dollar, marking its lowest opening since April 9. Heightened risk aversion stemming from fears of potential U.S. military involvement in West Asia has weighed on emerging market currencies. The rupee has now depreciated 0.86% month-to-date and 0.75% year-to-date.
Investors are bracing for potential volatility later in the day, as the Fed’s rate commentary and geopolitical developments continue to drive sentiment across asset classes.
## **Stock to focus on:**
**Hindustan Zinc** : In focus after declaring an interim dividend of ₹8 per share; record date set for June 25.
**Polycab India** : Added to the F&O segment from today, likely to see increased trading interest.
**Mahindra & Mahindra**: Under watch amid speculation of a potential battery cell JV with Ola Electric.
**Delhivery** : Likely to gain traction as brokerages remain optimistic on logistics volume growth.
**RailTel Corporation** : May see action after bagging a ₹120 crore order from SECL.
**Tata Power** : In view following renewed investor interest in renewable and EV-related plays.
