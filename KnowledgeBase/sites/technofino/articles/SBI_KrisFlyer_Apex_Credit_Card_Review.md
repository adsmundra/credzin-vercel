TheSBI KrisFlyer APEX Credit Cardis a co-branded travel card launched by SBI Card in partnership withSingapore Airlines’ KrisFlyerprogram. SBI has launched two cards simultaneously and here I am reviewing the pricier of the two. I have also reviewed the base version of this cardhere.

Just like theSBI Milescard series, there is no incentive for renewal against the annual fee and no renewal fee waiver makes no sense since why would someone renew the card and pay the fee against no benefits?

*Except for Cash withdrawals, Balance Transfers, Flexipay, Encash, E-wallet uploads, Cashback transactions and spends on Rental, Fuel, Utility Bills and Govt transactions.

Assuming you spend ₹10L on the included categories then in the first year of card accrual you will earn 53,000 KrisFlyer miles. Also earning these miles won’t be completely free since SBI will charge your card against the miles earned on spends done during the festive sales on various platforms like Amazon and Flipkart.

Now the value of aKrisFlyermile is inherently personal and depends on your travel patterns and preferences. But conservatively it can be valued around ₹1 per mile if you travel in economy but may shoot up substantially if you like to travel in premium cabins. Hence this translates to a 5.3% reward rate in the first year and 4.3% in the next year.

Access Via – Credit CardComplimentary Domestic Limit– 8 Visits/Calendar year within India only for primary cardholder (Maximum 2/Qtr)Network – MasterCard/AMEX

Access Via – Priority PassComplimentary International Limit– 8 Visits/Calendar year only for primary cardholder (Maximum 2/Qtr)

1% fuel surcharge waiver max up to ₹3000 per month.

SBI KrisFlyer Apex Credit Card is only for SQ loyalists just like how cobranded cards should be since the reward rate on other spends is quite mediocre. If you still like to rake up miles then this card is recommended for the first year since the reward rate drops significantly in the second year. Also KrisFlyer Gold won’t be easy to clinch if you don’t fly premium SQ cabins on revenue regularly. If you aren’t specific with Singapore Airlines, there are much better cards likeAxis Atlas,AMEX Platinum Travel, HDFC Infinia and HDFC Diners Club Black.
