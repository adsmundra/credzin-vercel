Virgin Atlantic, founded by Sir Richard Branson out of frustration with airline delays, began as a fun and innovative venture. Today, it stands as a serious player in the aviation industry with a vast global network and strong airline partnerships. As a member of the SkyTeam Alliance, Virgin Atlantic connects passengers to key destinations worldwide while offering highly rewarding redemption opportunities through its loyalty program, Flying Club.

Despite the recent revaluation of its dynamic award structure, which is making redemptions more challenging, the program remains undeniably lucrative. Let’s explore why Virgin Atlantic and its loyalty program the Virgin Atlantic Flying Club continue to be attractive choices for travellers.

For frequent flyers looking to maximize their travel experience, Virgin Atlantic’s Flying Club offers three elite status tiers: Red, Silver, and Gold. Each tier comes with exclusive perks that enhance your journey, whether you’re flying with Virgin Atlantic or one of its partner airlines.

Every new member of the Flying Club automatically starts at the Red tier. While it’s the base level, it still comes with some useful benefits, including:

Achieving Silver status requires earning 400 Tier Points. Silver members enjoy all the Red tier benefits, plus additional perks designed to improve the travel experience:

The highest level of Virgin’s Flying Club, Gold status, is attained by earning 1,000 Tier Points. Gold members unlock all Silver benefits, along with even more luxurious perks:

You can earn Virgin Atlantic Virgin points by flying with the airline, with the number of points determined by your flight distance, booking class, and Flying Club elite status. To easily estimate your earnings, useVirgin Atlantic’s points calculator.

As a member of the SkyTeam alliance, Virgin Atlantic also allows you to earn points when flying with partner airlines. To check how many points you’ll earn on a partner flight, visitVirgin Atlantic’s partner pageand select the airline you’re flying with. Your earnings will be based on your cabin class, booking category, and distance travelled.

In India, the only direct way to transfer points to your Flying Club account is through American Express Membership Rewards (MR) points. All of the available American Express cards, namely the Centurion card,Platinum Charge card, Platinum Reserve credit card,Platinum Travel credit card,Gold Charge card,Membership Rewards Credit card, andSmart Earn credit card, will allow their Membership Rewards points to be transferred to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club at the same given ratio.

You can also convert yourMarriott Bonvoypoints to Virgin Points.

*Additionally, for every 60,000 points transferred, you’ll receive a 5,000-mile bonus.

While this isn’t the most valuable option, it can be useful if you don’t have an American Express card. In that case, you can transfer your Axis Bank credit card points toMarriott Bonvoyand then move them to your Flying Club account. The Axis cards that may add some value are

You can refer to their transfer ratios fromhere. Though there are other cards of Axis Bank which do allow the transfer to Marriott Bonvoy, due to their poor transfer ratio, it’s advisable not to use them.

For better value, consider transferring toClub ITCfirst, then toMarriott Bonvoy, and finally to Flying Club. However, this process takes time due to transfer durations and capping limits, making it suitable only for long-term redemption plans rather than immediate use.

From an Indian traveller’s perspective, you can transfer yourWorld of Hyatt,IHG One Rewards, and Hilton Honorspoints to the Virgin Atlantic Flying Club. However, this transfer is not recommended, due to their poor conversion value.

In October 2024, Flying Club revamped its loyalty program, introducing dynamic pricing. Now, every seat on a Virgin Atlantic-operated flight can be booked with Virgin points. Similar to cash fares, award seat pricing varies based on demand. However, the points required for redemption are not directly tied to cash prices, leading to both great and poor redemption values.

When searching for award flights, look for Saver seats marked with a red tag, as they offer the lowest redemption rates. However, they won’t be available on every flight. To find the best deals, useVirgin’s Reward Seat Checkerfor the lowest-priced options. The only downside of this tool is that it only allows you to check award availability for flights to or from the UK.

Virgin Atlantic is a member of the SkyTeam Alliance, the newest among the big three airline alliances, founded in the year 2000. Being a part of SkyTeam allows Flying Club members to redeem points across 18 partner airlines, including:
