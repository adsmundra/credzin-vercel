Hi, can you help clarify a query I had on Axis Grabdeals. I hold an Axis Magnus CC. On the Grabdeals website, if I click on our partners, there is an offer available for Gift Edge which is another gift voucher platform in partnership with GyFTR. However, in the offer details, it is mentioned that only Edge Rewards eligible credit/debit cards issued by Axis Bank will get rewards on purchases made through this Edge Rewards portal. Can you clarify if Magnus CC is Edge Rewards enabled card? If yes, what is the max points one can on spends made on Gift vouchers purchased on this Edge Rewards portal?

Hi Puneet, Magnus Card is eligible for bonus points on the Gift Edge platform. But the limit isn’t clear. I think there is no limit on points which we can earn on GiftEdge platform, but need to clarify it.

Does this mean that we get a double cashback? Please clarify. I hold Flipkart Axis Cc, it offers 5% cashback on all flipkart orders. For instance, if I go to Flipkart through grabdeals link, do I get 5% more?
