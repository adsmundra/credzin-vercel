TATA Group of companies has an umbrella loyalty program for its brands and is called theNeuPass. It is an exclusive membership service linked with the Tata Neu Application, that confers upon its subscribers, several unique privileges with Tata brands. NeuCoins is the loyalty currency and is earned for every spend done on TATA brands and these add up to give you amazing experiences. The NeuCoins on the Tata Neu App can be used at any participating brands online, at IHCL hotels or in-store. The value of 1 NeuCoin = 1 Rupee and can be redeemed for no minimum order value.

Additionally, IHCL has a tier program called Taj InnerCircle within the NeuPass that provides you additional benefits and rewards based on your status. Starting from the top with the Platinum tier, you get unlimited room upgrades and your very own concierge to make your stay extra fancy. Move down to the Gold tier, and you get room vouchers and special help from the concierge. Even the Silver and Copper tiers are packed with awesome perks to make your journey special.

NeuPass is like your VIP ticket to a whole new level of travel with IHCL! Below is the chart of all the Taj InnerCircle tier benefits of NeuPass for IHCL Hotels.

HSBC India, in partnership with the Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL) and Visa, has introduced theHSBC Taj Credit Card, India’s first premium co-branded hospitality credit card.

In the past before NeuPass was launched IHCL allowed members to transfer credit card points, such as those from HSBC, to their Taj InnerCircle account and redeem them for any of the services in IHCL Hotels.

Also, TATA has launched cobranded cards for the NeuPass in collaboration with the HDFC Bank. The cards come in two variants

Both cards are quite popular among users since they work on the RuPay platform and are thus UPI-enabled. These cards offer the opportunity to earn up to 10% value back in the form of Neu Coins. Also, HDFC TATA NeuCard Infinity is one of the highest-rewarding UPI-based credit cards in India.

Additionally, you can redeem your credit card points and acquire Taj Experience Vouchers in various denominations through banking partners such asAMEX, SBI, and Standard Chartered Bank.AMEX Platinum Travelis the most popular card if you like to pamper yourself at Taj properties frequently. These vouchers can be applied towards settling bills at IHCL hotels, covering stays, food and beverage expenses, and other in-house consumables.

It’s important to note that reservations must be made at public rates rather than the members’ rates when using these vouchers for stays. While some hotels may make exceptions, many typically do not allow voucher redemption for bookings made at members’ rates which are visible in the Tata Neu App. Another important point related to these vouchers is that they work only in India and not at the overseas properties of IHCL.

IHCL offers a paid hotel membership program called Taj Epicure that offers exclusive discounts on dining, spa treatments, stays, and more. This membership comes in two variants:
