HDFC Bank has recently launched the most speculated and much-awaitedMarriott Bonvoycobranded credit card in India. This is the first credit card ever launched in India by one of the most renowned global hotel chains in the world. The card is available on the Diners Club platform.

Here’s everything you wish to know about the card.

The welcome benefit on this card is easily worth ₹7,500 minimum which is much more than the fee paid. Allow up to 12 weeks after paying the Joining Fee or Annual Membership Fee, or fulfilling the relevant spending thresholds, for your Free Night Award to be automaticallydeposited into your Marriott Bonvoy Member Account.

*Except for Fuel, Rental Payments, Packers and Movers, Government Transactions, Wallet loads, and Easy EMI transactions.

For Marriott Bonvoy we can assume one MB point to be easily around 50p though you can extract more than Re 1 at some properties in some regions.

Each Free Night Award is valid for 12 months and can be redeemed for a one-night stay, inclusive of room rate and applicable taxes, at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy with a redemption level of up to 15,000 Marriott Bonvoy Points.

Officially the bank has the following criteria but can vary as per your relationship with the bank.

For Self Employed Indian national

The mediocre features of this card suggest that Marriott is looking to tap into new customers or many who stay at Marriott properties but not into their loyalty programmeMarriott Bonvoy. I am also expecting a much more premium card either from HDFC Bank or ICICI Bank soon. This card is up for keep since the joining fee is well compensated by the joining benefits even if you don’t spend on this card.
