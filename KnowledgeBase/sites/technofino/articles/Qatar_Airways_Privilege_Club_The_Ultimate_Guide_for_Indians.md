Qatar Airways, the national carrier of Qatar, is renowned as one of the world’s most luxurious airlines. Its Business Class, known as Qsuites, is widely recognized as one of the top premium cabin offerings globally, while its First Class cabins aboard the A380 aircraft deliver an exceptional level of luxury. The airline’s loyalty program, Qatar Airways Privilege Club, uses Avios as its currency, offering members various opportunities to earn and redeem miles. As a part of the Oneworld alliance, Qatar Airways provides extensive global connectivity, allowing travellers to redeem Avios with a wide range of Oneworld partner airlines.Qatar Airways’ frequent flyer program, Privilege Club, uses Avios as its currency, the same currency used by British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Aer Lingus AerClub, and Finnair Plus. This allows members to easily transfer points between these programs at a 1:1 ratio, providing flexibility to redeem Avios for flights on preferred itineraries across any of the participating programs.

Qatar Airways Privilege Club offers four main membership tiers: Burgundy, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. These status levels are earned through Qpoints, which members accumulate by flying with Qatar Airways or select partner airlines. In addition to meeting the required Qpoints for each tier, members must earn 20% of their Qpoints—or fly at least four sectors in 12 months or eight sectors in 24 months—on Qatar Airways marketed or operated flights.

Members enjoy Oneworld elite benefits from the Silver tier and above, with the most exclusive perks available to Gold (Oneworld Sapphire) and Platinum (Oneworld Emerald) members.

Qualification: Just enrolling in the Privilege Club program.

As the base level, Burgundy allows you to earn and redeem Avios and accumulate Qpoints to advance to higher tiers.

Qualification: 150 Qpoints within 12 monthsMaintenance: 135 Qpoints in 12 months or 270 Qpoints in 24 months

Silver members gain access to a wide array of perks, including:

Qualification: 300 Qpoints within 12 monthsMaintenance: 270 Qpoints in 12 months or 540 Qpoints in 24 months

Gold status, equivalent to Oneworld Sapphire, provides enhanced benefits, such as:

Qualification: 600 Qpoints within 12 monthsMaintenance: 540 Qpoints in 12 months or 1,080 Qpoints in 24 months

Platinum members with the highest status enjoy Oneworld Emerald privileges, including access to First Class lounges with partner airlines. Additional benefits include:

Note: Qatar Airways Platinum Status offers an excellent opportunity for aspirational redemptions, such as Air France’s La Première. This exclusive award redemption is available only to members with Air France Platinum Status or higher. Currently, Qatar Airways Platinum members can secure a status match to Air France Platinum, but this benefit may be discontinued at any time. If you’re planning to take advantage of this, act quickly to secure your redemption.

You can earn Avios on paid Qatar Airways flights worldwide, with the amount earned depending on your cabin class and ticketed fare. Qatar Airways Privilege Club still calculates Avios based on the distance flown, though lower-tier discounted fare classes earn significantly fewer Avios than higher-tier fares. Earning rates typically range from 25% to 300% of the distance flown.

The easiest way to find out how many Avios you’ll earn on a Qatar Airways flight is by using the “My Calculator” feature on the airline’s website. The calculator will estimate how many Avios your journey will accrue by entering details such as your flight origin, destination, travel class, and elite status.

As an Oneworld alliance member, Qatar Airways Privilege Club allows its members to earn and redeem Avios across all Oneworld airline partners. In addition, Privilege Club members can also earn Avios with several of Qatar’s non-alliance airline partners. However, flights with non-alliance partners are not eligible to earn Status Points. You can check how many Avios you’ll earn on a partner airline’s flight just by using the “My Calculator” feature on the airline’s website by changing the airline’s option from Qatar to the desired partner airline.

In India Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and American Express allow you to transfer loyalty points to the Qatar Airways Privilege Club. At the same time, IndusInd Bank provides the only co-branded credit card with Qatar Airways in the country.

Here’s how you can use these cards to maximize your points for Qatar Airways.

The co-branded card offers a base earn rate of 0.5%, which means you earn 1 Avios for every ₹200 spent. While the reward rate may seem modest at 0.5%, the card offers significant value by granting you Privilege Club Gold status, which comes with exclusive benefits.

You can also transfer points from various hotel loyalty programs to your Qatar Airways Privilege Club account:

You can boost your Avios balance by linking your preferred hotel loyalty programs or hotel booking platforms with your Avios account. Here are some key options:

If you frequently rent cars while travelling, there’s good news—Qatar Airways partners with several car rental companies, allowing you to earn Avios with each rental. Some of the key partnerships are:

Qatar Airways often offers promotions for purchasing Avios. While buying points typically isn’t the best way to maximize their value, there are situations where it can make sense. For example, if you’re just short of the points needed to book an award ticket, purchasing Avios to top up your account can be a good option. Keep in mind, that the maximum number of Avios you can buy in a calendar year is capped at 250,000 points. To purchase Qatar Avios,click here.

You can redeem your Avios for flights on Qatar Airways, known for its world-class Business Class product, the QSuite. This enclosed suite offers exceptional comfort and luxury, complemented by a fine dining experience. Qatar Airways also operates its unique First Class, which, while a bit dated, still delivers an outstanding experience. If you’re departing from Doha, you’ll gain access to the Al Safwa First Class Lounge, one of the finest in the world. This exclusive lounge offers gourmet dining and the chance to relax in a luxurious spa. Access is limited to First Class passengers, Privilege Club Platinum members travelling in Business Class with Qatar Airways, and oneworld First Class passengers—underscoring its exclusivity.

To determine how many Avios you’ll need for a flight, check theMy Calculatortool. Qatar Airways recently introduced peak and off-peak seasons for award redemptions. Off-peak redemptions offer excellent value, so being flexible with your travel dates can help you save Avios. Availability, especially in premium cabins, can be limited, so it’s best to book as early as possible to secure seats.

Off-peak Business Class redemptions are one of the best ways to maximize your Qatar Avios, thanks to the airline’s exceptional service and product quality.

Please note that Qatar Airways has recently (September 2024) increased its already somewhat high taxes on award redemptions. Although they rolled back an earlier doubling of taxes, the overall tax on redemptions has still risen by 10-20%.

You can also use your Qatar Avios to upgrade paid flights operated by the airline. To find the cost of upgrading a specific flight, use Qatar Airways’Miles Calculator, which calculates the Avios required based on your route and fare class. However, this option is generally not the most economical in terms of miles redemption. At TechnoFino, we suggest keeping this as a last resort for unplanned upgrades, as it’s not the best way to maximize your Avios.

You can redeem Avios for many partner awards, including flights operated by American Airlines, JetBlue, British Airways, and Virgin Australia, directly online. If a partner flight doesn’t appear online, you can contact Qatar Airways Privilege Club at +91 95128 72827 to book over the phone. However, keep in mind the call centre operates only during regular working hours on weekdays.

Qatar Airways has recently aligned its Avios redemption rates with other Avios partners, using a distance-based award chart for partner airlines. Below is the updated award chart:

For short-haul flights operated by American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, the updated pricing is as follows:

Qatar Airways may not have many sweet spots due to its taxes, carrier-imposed fees, and moderate Avios requirements, but there are still some aspirational redemptions worth considering. These include the award-winning QSuite in Business Class, Qatar Airways’ First Class, and a few short-haul flights offering great value.

For those looking to experience Qatar Airways First Class, especially on the Boeing 777, you can fly from Doha (DOH) to Bangkok (BKK) for 97,500 Avios (peak) or 75,000 Avios (off-peak) plus 600 QAR in taxes one-way. On this route, Qatar also operates the A380, which offers a superior first-class product, but these tend to sell out quickly.

To try Qatar’s QSuite from India, a great option is the Mumbai (BOM) to Auckland (AKL) route via Doha (DOH). This flight can be booked for 80,000 Avios during off-peak periods.

Additionally, you can book inter-country or intra-country flights within Southeast Asia for as low as 6,000 Avios. However, these flights are not bookable online and require a call to Qatar Airways’ helpline for redemption.

Qatar Airways’ Family Programme, one of the best features of the Privilege Club, allows you to pool Avios with up to nine family members. Eligible members include your spouse, children over 2 years old, parents, and your spouse’s parents. Once your family account is set up, Avios earned by all members are combined, helping you reach redemption goals more quickly. For more details,click here.

Children under 2 are classified as infants, but whether they qualify for an infant fare depends on how they are travelling. If a baby is seated on an adult’s lap, they are considered a lap infant and eligible for an infant fare, which is typically 15% of the adult fare. For children under 2 travelling in their seats, a child fare will apply, usually about 75% of the adult fare.

Qatar Airways classifies children under 11 as eligible for child fares on routes where this option is available. Once a child turns 12, they are considered an adult and must pay the full fare.

Qatar Airways Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity. To keep your Avios from expiring, ensure you have some form of qualifying activity, such as flying with Qatar Airways or its partners, purchasing, gifting, or sharing Avios, or converting points from a Qatar transfer partner. For Platinum members, Avios never expire as long as the status is maintained. However, combining Avios with your British Airways account typically won’t extend the expiration.

To reach Qatar Airways’ support centre, you can call +91 95128 72827. Alternatively, log in to your account and go to the “Contact Center” section to fill out the contact form. If you need the complete list of contact centres, simplyclick here.

Qatar Airways offers exceptional products both on the ground and in the air. If you’ve never experienced long-haul business class, the world-renowned Qsuite to Doha and beyond is a top choice. The ability to seamlessly transfer Avios between five different airline loyalty programs makes Qatar’s Privilege Club even more appealing, especially with its short-haul pricing now aligning with the popular rates in the British Airways Executive Club program. While the Privilege Club has had its ups and downs in terms of user experience and value, it remains a solid option overall, even with the recent changes.
