# New Axis Bank SuperMoney RuPay Credit Card
13 May, 2025  / By  [ Kartik Kanwar  ](https://cardinsider.com/author/kartik/ "View all posts by Kartik Kanwar") /  [15 Comments](https://cardinsider.com/blog/new-axis-bank-supermoney-rupay-credit-card/#comments)
super.money by Flipkart has introduced one of the most habit-changing and revolutionary UPI apps in recent times. Users across the country have discovered that super.money is among the most rewarding platforms for UPI transactions. To elevate this experience, super.money first launched the secured [superCard Credit Card](https://cardinsider.com/utkarsh-small-finance-bank/supercard-credit-card/), which offered credit access backed by a fixed deposit as low as ₹100. Building on that success, super.money has now partnered with Axis Bank to introduce another rewarding credit card.
![Just Launched Axis Bank SuperMoney RuPay Credit Card](https://cd9941cc.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Just-Launched-Axis-Bank-SuperMoney-RuPay-Credit-Card.webp)
The new Axis Bank SuperMoney RuPay Credit Card offers an **impressive 3% cashback on UPI** spends, a standout benefit considering that most credit cards in India do not offer such high cashback for UPI transactions
## Up to 3% Cashback on UPI Spends and More!
  * Flat 3% Cashback on UPI Spends via RuPay
  * Flat 1% Cashback on All Other Transactions
  * 100% Fuel Surcharge Waiver
  * Exclusive Cashback Offers on Brands like Ola, Myntra, MakeMyTrip & More
  * Free Physical Card | Lifetime Free Credit Card
  * Maximum Cashback of ₹500 Each Statement Cycle
  * 55.55% Interest Rate Per Annum


![superCard Pro Benefits](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20628'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
_Cashback shall not be awarded for the following._
  * Fuel
  * Jewelry
  * Cash Withdrawal
  * Wallet Load
  * Insurance
  * Education
  * Government Services
  * Rent
  * EMI Transactions

## Bottom Line
With the launch of two co-branded credit cards, one with Utkarsh Small Finance Bank and the other with Axis Bank super.money by Flipkart, is clearly aiming to disrupt the UPI payments market, challenging established players like [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/) and Google Pay. This strategy seems to be working, especially among youngsters who are increasingly choosing super.money for their UPI spends and opting for the co-branded secured super.money Credit Card.
While the superCard is ideal for beginners looking to build their credit history, the new SuperMoney RuPay Credit Card (superCard Pro), in collaboration with Axis Bank, is a must-have for seasoned credit card users who want to maximize rewards on their UPI payments.
_Individuals who frequently use UPI should consider this card. To maximize cashback, one must spend ₹16,667 each statement cycle._

You most probably wont be eligible for it. Only those who do not already have the Super Money Credit Card are seeing the option to apply for both cards.

This Needs to be highlighted: Maximum Cashback of ₹500 Each Statement Cycle. This card probably wont disrupt the upi card market by any means . Maximum Cashback Per statement cycle should be at least 1000 in my opinion.

Even 500 is fine for UPI spends. If someone has such high spends only for UPI, they should def shift to a credit card. Also not many know about it but it is highly rewarding app for UPI spends.

I started applying for utkarsh based card that it was showing before, but changed my mind and stopped in between, and now the card tab is stuck at “fetch kyc documents” step of the same. How do I cancel this and see the new supermoney card?!
