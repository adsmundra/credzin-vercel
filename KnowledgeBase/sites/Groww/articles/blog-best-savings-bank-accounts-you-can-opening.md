## **Factors to Consider While Opening a Savings Account**
The essential things to consider while opening a savings account are as follows-
  * ### **Rate of Interest**
The interest rate provided is a key factor in choosing where to invest your money because it determines how much interest your savings will generate for you.Make a wise choice because even a subtle variation in the interest rate offered can pay off in the long run! 
  * ### **Minimum Cash Balance**
Many banks have minimal deposits that you must make in order to open a savings account with them. Similar to this, there are some lenders who will require you to keep a certain minimum balance in your account throughout your relationship with them.There are banks, of course, that do not require a minimum balance in your [savings account](https://groww.in/savings-account). Some people favour this option because it gives them more freedom in how they can use their money, while others prefer the idea of a minimum balance because it encourages them to be thriftier and more responsible with their money.In the end, everything comes down to personal preference.


  * ### **Regularity of Withdrawals**
There are monthly withdrawal restrictions on many accounts. Choose an account that allows frequent withdrawals without incurring fees if you think you might need to do so.


  * ### **Fees and Charges**
Your Savings Account may be subject to a variety of fees, including monthly fees, cross-currency markup, PIN regeneration fees, and more.Additionally, you must take into account the maintenance fees that will probably be deducted from your account each year. Going through the fine print carefully will help you become familiar with these fees, as at the end of the day, opening a savings account is all about saving money.
  * ### **Customer Service**
Customer service is of the utmost importance in the [banking](https://groww.in/banking) industry. You ought to be able to get in touch with customer service right away and ask them to solve any problems you encounter.You should actively stay in touch with a bank that has a stellar reputation for providing exceptional customer service, whether the issue is a stolen debit card or you are unable to transfer funds.
