**9.** | **Reduction in TDS/TCS Rates** | 50,000  
| **Subtotal for Day 1** | 5,94,550  
The measures announced on May 13, 2020 were focused on direct tax, real estate and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). There were also some liquidity measures announced for Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFC), Housing Finance Companies (HFC) and Micro Finance Institutions (MFI). 
A total of 15 measures were announced today and divided across different sectors. Let’s look at these sector by sector for a deeper understanding:
## **Direct Tax**
**TDS reduction** : Beginning May 14 and until March 31, 2021, TDS and TCS rates have been reduced by 25% from the existing rates across all categories: be its dividend payments or interest on investments and likewise. 
This reduction will release around Rs 50,000 crore in the hands of the people. 
**Refunds:** All pending refunds will be issued immediately to charitable institutions, non-corporates, businesses, partnership and sole proprietorship.
**ITR filing date extended:** The last**date to file ITR is being extended to November 30, 2020, from July 31, 2020.**
**Vivaad se Vishwas Scheme** :This scheme has been extended to December 31, 2020.
**Direct Tax Measures: What does it mean for you?**
TDS has been cut on 23 items like dividend payments, interest on deposits, bank accounts, etc. The TDS and TCS reduction is not applicable for tax payers who do not furnish their PAN card. This is for non salaried transactions only. TDS on salary has not been reduced. 
**What does this mean for you?**
In short, you will be paying less taxes on your financial investments. All the income that you earn from various investments that were applicable for a deduction of 10% TDS will now be reduced by 25% to 7.5%. You will basically get more interest, dividends and income from your Investments because you will be paying less taxes on them. 
Here are a few important ones where you will be paying lesser TDS:
**Items for which TDS has been reduced to 7.5% from 10%**
  * Dividend
  * Interest on debentures
  * Any amount withdrawn which was deposited under the National Savings Scheme 
  * Payment of compensation on acquisition of immovable property. Immovable property here means any building or land, except agricultural land.


**TDS reduced to 3.75% from 5%**
  * Proceeds that you received from your life insurance policy were taxable a 5%. Now it has been reduced to 3.75%.


## **EPF**
**Liquidity relief :** Liquidity relief for all EPF establishments with 100 employees and less than Rs 15,000 take-home salary was announced earlier. The government had supported the EPF contributions for both the employer and employee for all such organisations until May 2020. 
This relief has been extended for another three months. A liquidity relief of Rs 2,500 crore to 72.22 lakh employees will be provided by extending this contribution until August 2020. 
**Statutory PF contribution****:** The statutory PF contribution for those who are not covered in the earlier measure, both the employer and employee contribution, is being reduced to 10% from 12%. 
For Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) and State Public Sector Undertakings (PSU), the government will continue to pay 12% from the employer side however employees will be given the advantage of contributing 10%. This will increase their take-home pay.
**EPF Reduction: What does it mean for you?**
**Increase in take-home but higher taxes!**
If you are a private sector employee, you will be contributing lesser towards your EPF corpus. If earlier you were mandated to contribute 12% of your basic salary towards provident fund, you will now be contributing 10%. This means that.your take home salary will increase. However, another implication of this does tend towards higher incidence of taxes.
**Higher income tax:** PF contributions can been claimed under section 80 C for income tax deduction. If you chose for the EPF reduction, you will be getting lesser tax benefit because you will be contributing lesser towards your PF. Also, an increase in take home pay will increase your taxable salary and there you may be paying higher income tax. As mentioned before, TDS on salary has not been reduced. That rate remains the same. You can still choose to voluntarily contribute 12% only. 
If you are a government employee, the government will be paying for your and the employer’s (which is GOI itself) contribution. 
## **Real Estate**
Real estate project registrations and completion deadlines can be extended suo moto by 6 months if the projects were registered on or before March 25, 2020. By suo moto the FM means that no individual applications will be required for the extension. As per earlier Rera guidelines, delays in project completion and registration would have invited penalties.
**Real Estate Projects Relaxation: What does this mean for you?**
The measure announced is good for the developers. However, may be bad news for.you as you might get your house later than the earlier promised delivery date.
## **MSMEs**
**Collateral free automatic loan****:** Around Rs 3 lakh crore will go towards collateral-free loans for the MSME sector. Such enterprises that have Rs 25 crore outstanding loan and 100 crore turnover will benefit from this. 
The loan will have a 4-year tenor and no fresh collateral will be required. MSMEs will be given a 12-month moratorium. This is expected to benefit 45 lakh units and will help resume business activity and safeguard jobs. This will aid stranded MSMEs
**Subordinate debt provision : Around Rs 20,000 crore-worth debt provision is being provided for stressed MSMEs.**
**Fund of fund** : An equity infusion of Rs 50,000 crore via a fund of the fund will be used to expand capacities and business prospects for MSMEs who are doing well in business otherwise but need a bit of hand holding during such testing times.
**Change in definition :** The finance minister also changed the definition of MSMEs so that maximum enterprises can benefit from this scheme. For manufacturing and services units, the investment can be up to Rs 1 crore and your turnover can be up to Rs 5 crore to be called as micro-enterprises, Rs 10 crore investment and Rs 50 crore turnover for small enterprises and Rs 20 crore investment and Rs 100 turnover for medium enterprises.
**Global Tenders :** Global tenders of up to Rs 200 crore will not be allowed. This has been done to support the businesses of home grown MSMEs. 
**MSME receivables :** Within the next 45 days, all pending MSME receivables will be honoured by the government and CPSEs.
**Existing MSME Classification [ Criteria : Investment in Plant & Machinery or Equipment]**  
---  
Classification | Micro | Small | Medium  
Mfg. Enterprises | Investment < Rs 25 Lac | Investment < Rs 5 Cr | Investment< Rs 10 Cr  
Services Enterprise | Investment < Rs 10 Lac | Investment < Rs 2 Cr | Investment < Rs 5 Cr

Classification | Micro | Small | Medium  
Manufacturing and services | Investment < Rs 1 Cr & Turnover < Rs 5 Cr | Investment < Rs 10 Cr & Turnover < Rs 50 Cr | Investment < Rs 20 Cr & Turnover < Rs 100 Cr  
**MSME Liquidity Provision: What does it mean for you?**
All provisions under MSMEs, if you are a business man, will help you to avail cheap credit easily. This has been done to spur economic activity.
## **NBFC, MFI and HFCs**
**Special liquidity scheme****:** Rs 30,000 crore is being provided for a special liquidity scheme. This investment will be made in primary and secondary markets. Debt papers of these organisations will be bought by the government. 
Not just high quality but even investment-grade papers will be bought for struggling NBFCs. This move is pexted to improve their liquidity situation. 
**Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme 2.0****:** Around Rs, 45,000 crores is being allocated to cover the liability side of their balance sheets. First 20% of the loss will be borne by the guarantor which is the Government of India. 
To expand the scope of benefit, the government will also take over the AA-rated papers and below and even unrated papers will be eligible for investment. This will help microfinance institutions.
On a larger note, the FM and the PM have mentioned that the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan scheme will be focusing on five pillars of growth:
  * Economy
  * Infrastructure
  * Technology-driven systems
  * Demography
  * Demand


Sitharaman further said that the focus of the mission is on four factors of products: land, labour, liquidity, and law. This would directly mean that ease of doing business, compliance and such issues will have to be taken care of. Both the FM and the PM have stressed on the intention to take local brands and build them on a global scale.
