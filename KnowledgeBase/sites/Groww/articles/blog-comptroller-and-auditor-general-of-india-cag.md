## **Functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India**

  * Serving as an advisor to the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament and maintaining the accounts of state governments. In 1976, the **CAG** was relieved of the responsibility of compiling and maintaining the accounts of the Government of India due to the separation of accounts from audit through departmentalisation.


## **Reports Submitted by the CAG**
A **Comptroller and Auditor General of India** prepares audit reports based on its findings during the audit process. These reports are submitted to the President or the Governors of the respective states, as required by the Constitution.
A CAG’s reports are categorised as follows:
  * Audit Reports on Appropriation Accounts
  * Audit Reports on Finance and Revenue Accounts
  * Audit Report on Public Undertakings


These reports highlight financial irregularities, rule violations, and inefficiencies in financial management and offer recommendations for improvement. Once submitted, the reports are presented in Parliament or state legislatures, where they are discussed and debated. They play a crucial role in holding the government accountable and prompting corrective actions.
## **Structure of CAG’s Office**
The **CAG** heads the Indian Audit and Accounts Department (IAAD), supported by five Deputy Comptrollers and Auditors General.
The hierarchy structure of the CAG office is as follows:
  * CAG
  * Deputy CAG
  * Additional Deputy CAG
  * Directors General
  * Principal Director
  * Directors/Deputy Directors


## **Different Articles Related to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India**
The CAG holds the same stature as a Supreme Court judge, ranking ninth in importance. Articles 148 to 151 of the Constitution outline the roles and responsibilities of the CAG.
  * Article 148 details the appointment, oath, tenure, and removal of the **CAG**. The President of India appoints the CAG, whose tenure is six years or until reaching 65 years of age, whichever is earlier. The CAG cannot be re-elected and can be removed by the President on grounds of proven misbehaviour or incapacity, endorsed by both houses of Parliament.
  * Article 149 specifies the powers and duties of the CAG, which include auditing the accounts of the Indian government, state governments, and other government-owned entities.
  * Article 150 of the constitution pertains to the form in which the Union's accounts shall be maintained, as directed by the President upon the advice of the **Comptroller and Auditor General of India**. The CAG advises on the maintenance of both Union and state government accounts.
  * Article 151 addresses the submission of audit reports by India's Comptroller and Auditor General. 


Reports concerning the Union's accounts are submitted to the President of India, while those related to State accounts are submitted to the respective State Governors. These reports must be presented before their respective legislative bodies.
## **Removal of the Auditor General of India**
The President of India can remove the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) under the same conditions as a Supreme Court judge.
This requires a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament with a special majority, based on proven misbehaviour or incapacity.
## **The Bottom Line**
Overall, the **Comptroller and Auditor General of India** plays a vital role in ensuring accountability and transparency in financial affairs. As India advances economically and socially, the CAG's role remains essential.
