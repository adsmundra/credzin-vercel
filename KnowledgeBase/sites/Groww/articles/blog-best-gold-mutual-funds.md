## **Why Invest in Gold Mutual Funds?**
Here are several benefits of investing in gold funds. Let’s take a close look at how investing in one can help investors.
### **Diversification**
Diversifying one’s portfolio is a great way to mitigate risks and stabilise returns. Along with diversifying across sectors and stocks, investors can also diversify by investing in multiple asset classes such as gold. Investing in a gold mutual fund can help investors achieve this goal.
### **Ease and Convenience**
Although investing in gold can be a fruitful activity, this traditional way of investing holds several challenges. A gold mutual fund solves these challenges by allowing investors to digitally invest in gold and gold-related assets. Further, a gold mutual fund also eliminates the need to physically store gold.
### **Professional Management**
A key hurdle that many investors face is deciding when to buy or sell a particular asset. Since gold mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers, investors do not have to make these key decisions.
### **Investing Through SIP**
Investors can invest in a gold [mutual fund](https://groww.in/mutual-funds/filter) through a systematic investment plan (SIP). An SIP eliminates the need for a large capital, making investing easy. One can begin their investment journey with as little as Rs 100. Moreover, SIP offers high flexibility and a better cost-price average.
### **Key Limitations of Gold Mutual Funds**
Similar to most investments, gold mutual funds have several limitations too.
  * The value of gold mutual funds is typically linked to the value of gold which can be highly volatile. Several micro- and macroeconomic factors can impact the value of the yellow metal.
  * Since gold mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers, they may not be suitable for investors who want to be more proactive in their decision-making process and prefer a more hands-on approach.


### **Conclusion**
The best gold mutual funds can be suitable options for investors looking to widen their asset allocation and diversification. Additionally, they can also be viable investment options for those looking to invest in physical gold as gold mutual funds solve the challenges of investing in physical gold. While investing, it is important to compare the different gold funds and understand the factors that can impact the value of gold prices.
