Keeping that aside, the joining/renewal fee waiver conditions are pretty good for a card of this range and have amazing benefits.

TechnoFino Tip

Align your billing cycle of the HDFC Credit Cards as much as possible with the calendar month by asking the bank to shift your billing cycle date to the 2nd of every month to minimize the calculations related to the capping of CashPoints and SmartBuy cashback. HDFC doesn’t allow the first and last two days of the month as your billing cycle date.

₹1000 worth of gift vouchers on spends of ₹1,00,000 and above in each calendar quarter or you can generate airport lounge access if you wish to since now this card is not giving complimentary airport lounge access. I would suggest you opt for the gift voucher and hunt for other cards which provide complimentary airport lounge access.

For instance, if you spend more than Rs 1 lakh during the January to March quarter, HDFC Bank will send you an SMS indicating your eligibility for milestone benefits. Upon logging in, you will need to select either an airport lounge access voucher or a gift voucher. Most people are likely to choose the Rs 1000 gift voucher, as airport lounge access is available with other credit/debit cards.

If you opt for the airport lounge access voucher, you will receive a digital DreamFolks QR code via email. This code is valid for 90 days and can be used at the selected airport lounges depending on your card variant.

As this is a cashback credit card as per HDFC Bank, the table above clearly shows the intention of HDFC Bank here is to make conditions favourable for a statement credit. It’s a win-win for users and why not! After all, hard cash is better than all other redemptions if you are not getting better value than cash.

1% fuel surcharge waiver at all fuel stations across India. (On minimum transaction of ₹400 & maximum transaction of ₹5,000. Maximum waiver of ₹250 per statement cycle).

The eligibility conditions are not that high and the bank is also a bit flexible on them. So if you have a good relationship with HDFC Bank and are a bit underqualified for the criteria still we would recommend you ask for a Millennia Credit Card and the bank may approve it.

For Self EmployedIndian NationalAge: Min 21 yrs & Max 40 Yrs, Income: ITR > ₹6.0 Lakhs per annum

Unofficially if you have an existing credit card with HDFC Bank having a 1L limit then you can ask for an upgrade.

Anyone who has been tracking this card can easily judge that the card has been quite simplified now. With the minimum transaction amount limit removed and points validity extended by a year, this card has become highly rewarding even for a normal user who doesn’t understand the complexities of the T&C and is not a high spender.

We highly recommend this card to every millennial out there looking to get a hand on a reward-worthy credit card but are not able to decide which card to choose from due to a plethora of options out there. This one card can meet your every need from shopping, dining, commuting, apparel, and all those other things. We also recommend everyone maintain and build a long relationship with HDFC Bank as it is one of the most rewarding banks in the Indian banking space.
