## Who Should Invest in ELSS Funds?
The best performing ELSS mutual funds can stand favourable to:
**1. Investors Who Want to Save through Tax**
ELSS funds are appropriate for any taxpayer prepared to take the risks of an equity-associated tax-saving device. This is the only 3-year scheme coming under Section 80C for tax benefits.
**2. Long Term Investors**
As previously mentioned, ELSS funds have a lock-in period; this lock-in period ensures you stay invested in the fund for at least three years. Moreover, these funds tend to perform much better when you continue, even after the lock-in period, to witness the growth potential.
_Assessing your returns on ELSS mutual funds investments is easy. Simply use the[ELSS calculator](https://groww.in/calculators/elss-calculator) and estimate your returns over a period of your choice._
## Factors to be Considered while Investing in ELSS Funds
The following factors to consider when finding and choosing the best ELSS funds to invest in 2025:
  1. **Lock-In Period of the Fund**


ELSS funds come with a lock-in period, as mentioned earlier, and the minimum lock-in period of the fund is three years. The investments need to be kept for a minimum of three years, and it is not possible to redeem the holdings before it. Therefore, the investors who invest in these funds will have to be considerate of this factor. 
  1. **Returns of the Fund**


You should be aware that ELSS funds do not provide guaranteed returns because they are fully contingent on the performance of the underlying securities. A longer investment horizon, however, can yield larger returns than any other tax-saving investment alternative.
  1. **Investment Horizon**


To invest in ELSS funds, you need to have a longer investment horizon, perhaps longer than five years. To limit market volatility, the equity exposure of ELSS funds requires a longer investment horizon.
## Major Advantages
Here are some of the benefits of investing in the **best ELSS mutual fund in 2025** :
  * **Shortest lock-in period:** The 3-year lock-in period of ELSS mutual funds is the shortest among other tax-saving investment options. For example, [PPF](https://groww.in/p/savings-schemes/public-provident-fund-ppf/) has a minimum maturity period of 15 years. Hence, tax-saver fund schemes are more liquid.


  * **Potential to generate high returns:** Contrary to ELSS mutual funds, other tax-saving investment options, like bank fixed deposits and PPF, generate a fixed income. Conversely, ELSS funds invest in stocks of different companies, and their NAV fluctuates accordingly. An uptick in prices of such underlying securities can yield sizeable returns for investors. 
  * **Tax benefit:** Investments up to Rs.1.5 lakh are eligible for tax deductions as per the provisions of the [Income Tax Act](https://groww.in/p/tax/income-tax-act/). 


**Investment modes:** Two routes via which individuals can invest in the **best ELSS mutual funds** are– Systematic Investment Plan and lump-sum. SIP allows individuals to invest in a scheme by paying fixed instalments at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.). On the flip side, the lump-sum method allows investors to allocate the available funds to an ELSS mutual fund scheme in one go.
## Risks Involved While Investing in ELSS Funds
While finding the best ELSS funds 2025, ensure to check the associated risks:
  1. **Liquidity Risk**


Liquidity risk in mutual funds refers to the probability that investors will be unable to redeem their investments without experiencing a loss in value. Investments in ELSS funds will be subject to a three-year lock-in period. The investor cannot redeem or transfer his or her ELSS investment during the lock-in period. 
  1. **Market Risk**


Market risk is the probability that investors will suffer losses as a result of the market's bad performance. There are numerous reasons that might have an adverse effect on stock market prices, including recession, political considerations, market sentiment, and so on. 
Equity Linked Savings Schemes must invest at least 80% of their assets in equity securities. As a result, an ELSS fund's portfolio is subject to market risk.
### **FAQ**
### **Q1. Are ELSS funds better than mutual funds?**
ELSS and mutual funds differ only because of the tax deductions and lock-in period factors. If an investor wants an investment plus tax saving option, he/she can opt for ELSS funds.
### **Q2. Are ELSS funds tax-free after a period of 3 years?**
The taxation of an ELSS fund works such as -
The invested has redeemed the fund at Rs. 3 lakh, and based on the criteria of deduction, Rs. 1.5 lakh will be exempted from tax. Thus, after deducting Rs 1.5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh, taxable income equals Rs 1.5 lakh.
### **Q3. What are the demerits of ELSS funds?**
There are two major risks associated with this fund, and that is liquidity and market risk. This means they can't be liquidated when required; you will have to stay invested for a fixed period, and since these funds invest majorly in equity markets, it does not hold guaranteed returns. 
### **Q4. How many years is the tax benefit of the ELSS fund?**
The tax benefits of the fund apply throughout its lock-in period. 
### **Q5. Who should not invest in ELSS?**
ELSS mutual funds are more suitable for long-term investors. Hence, if you have a longer investment horizon, ELSS can be a good choice.
**_Disclaimer_** _: Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme-related documents carefully._
