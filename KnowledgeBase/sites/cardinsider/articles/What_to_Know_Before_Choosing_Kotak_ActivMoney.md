# What to Know Before Choosing Kotak ActivMoney?
16 May, 2025  / By  [ Pranjal Kimta  ](https://cardinsider.com/author/pranjal/ "View all posts by Pranjal Kimta") /  [Leave a Comment](https://cardinsider.com/blog/what-know-before-choosing-kotak-activmoney/#respond)
Fixed deposits (FDs) are a popular investment option that allows individuals to park their savings with banks for a fixed period, earning a predetermined interest rate. This traditional banking instrument provides safety and regular returns, making it a preferred choice for many.
Kotak Mahindra Bank has introduced a feature called Kotak ActivMoney that upgrades the traditional FD concept. ActivMoney automatically transfers any excess funds from your [savings or current account](https://cardinsider.com/blog/savings-account-vs-current-account/) into a fixed deposit, allowing your money to earn a higher interest rate without additional effort on your part.
![Every Detail About Kotak ActivMoney](https://cd9941cc.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Every-Detail-About-Kotak-ActivMoney.webp)
For example, if you have a balance of ₹1 lakh in your account and the threshold is set at ₹25,000, Kotak ActivMoney will automatically move ₹75,000 into a fixed deposit. This way, you’re earning a competitive interest rate of up to 6.50% while still having easy access to your funds when you need them.
In this article, you will learn everything you need to know about Kotak ActivMoney, including how it works, its features, benefits, and the simple steps to avail of this banking facility.
## Understanding Kotak ActivMoney
Kotak ActivMoney is a smart banking feature that helps you earn more interest on your savings without any extra effort. If you have money in your savings or current account that exceeds a certain limit, this service automatically moves the extra amount into a Fixed Deposit (FD). By doing this, you earn a higher interest rate, just like with traditional FDs, while still keeping access to your money whenever you need it. There’s no penalty for withdrawing your funds, so you can take them out at any time. Kotak ActivMoney helps you make your unused money work better for you. It offers an easy way to increase your savings.
## How Does Kotak ActivMoney Work?
ActivMoney operates on a simple, yet well-planned model known as the “sweep in and sweep out” facility. Here’s how it works:
  * **Threshold Establishment:** When you enroll in ActivMoney, a default threshold is set for your savings account. For instance, if you have a Kotak Edge Savings Account, the threshold might be ₹25,000. This means that any amount above this sum can be swept into a Fixed Deposit.
  * **Automatic Transfers:** If your account balance exceeds the threshold (say ₹25,000), the excess funds are automatically transferred to a Fixed Deposit. For example, if your balance is ₹1 lakh, ₹75,000 would be placed into a 180-day FD, earning the interest rate.
  * **Accessing Your Funds:** If your balance falls below the threshold due to any withdrawals, the required funds are automatically withdrawn from your FD to cover the shortage. This guarantees that you are never penalized for needing access to your money, as you can withdraw funds whenever necessary.
  * **Breaking the FD:** Should you need to withdraw prematurely from your FD, there is no penalty as long as the amount is broken after 7 days. If you break the FD very early (within 45 days), the interest earned might be lower than what you would typically earn in a savings account.


## Features of Kotak ActivMoney
  * **Impressive Interest Rates:** One of ActivMoney’s standout features is its interest rate, which can be as high as 6.50% per annum. This rate is higher than the standard interest offered on regular savings accounts.
  * **No Lock-in Period:** Unlike traditional Fixed Deposits, which often come with a lock-in period, ActivMoney allows you access to your funds anytime. You don’t have to worry about losing access to your money during emergencies or unforeseen circumstances.
  * **Easy Withdrawals:** Withdrawals from your FD are flexible and can be made without facing any penalties, provided the dissolution meets certain conditions. This flexibility ensures peace of mind, knowing that your funds are not tied up indefinitely.
  * **Automatic Sweep Facility:** The automatic transfer of excess funds to a Fixed Deposit ensures that you don’t have to manually manage your investments. This saves you time and helps you earn better returns without any extra effort.
  * **Simplicity in Management:** ActivMoney simplifies fund management by consolidating your savings and investments in one account. You can easily keep track of your savings balance, FD balance, and total available funds without needing to juggle multiple accounts.
  * **FD Creation and Breaking Rules:** For new ActivMoney registrations, FDs will be created and broken in multiples of ₹5,000, providing more flexibility in managing your funds.


## Benefits of Kotak ActivMoney
The ActivMoney allows its users to enjoy multiple benefits, such as the following:
  * **No Minimum Balance Worries:** As long as you keep the required minimum balance in your account, funds above that amount will be transferred to earn better interest.
  * **Simple Process:** Activating and using the facility is straightforward, allowing you to make the most of your money without hassle.
  * **Liquidity:** You can use your [savings account balance and Fixed Deposit](https://cardinsider.com/blog/choosing-between-savings-account-fixed-deposit/) together for any transaction, like ATM withdrawals or online shopping.


## How to Book for Kotak ActivMoney?
To book for Kotak ActivMoney, you can either visit the bank branch or apply online. The steps are quite simple and easy to follow, and users can easily take advantage of Kotak ActivMoney. Users can even download the Kotak811 app and enable ActivMoney on it. They can even call customer service at 1860-266-0811 for more help.
## Eligibility Criteria for Kotak ActivMoney
  * You can use the ActivMoney service with both savings and current accounts for residents, as well as for non-resident customers.
  * To use the ActivMoney service, you must have a PAN.


## Bottom Line
Kotak ActivMoney offers a smart solution for those looking to make the most of their savings. By automatically moving excess funds into a fixed deposit, you can earn higher interest rates without any extra work. This feature not only provides easy access to your money but also eliminates the worries of penalties when withdrawing. With impressive interest rates and no lock-in period, Kotak ActivMoney stands out as an excellent choice for managing your finances.
