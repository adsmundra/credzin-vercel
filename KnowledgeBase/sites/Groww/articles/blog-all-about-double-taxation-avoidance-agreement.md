Taxing the same income or subject matter more than once for the same reason, over the same time period, and in the same tax jurisdiction is known as Double Taxation. When such income is taxed in two different countries, the total tax obligation will constitute a sizable portion of his overall income.
Every person must work to support themselves. Taxes can be difficult to pay in both the country of residence and the country of employment. The DTAA full form Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement was signed by India and 85 other nations, including DTAA between India and USA, to resolve these problems. It enables NRIs who work abroad to avoid paying taxes twice on their income from both their home country and their country of residence.
In this blog, we will find out more about this contract of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement and how it works.
## **What is Double Taxation?**
[Double Taxation](https://groww.in/blog/how-to-get-double-taxation-relief) agreements merely seek to do away with Double Taxation in instances of cross-border income flow. They are widely pursued by nations to prevent a situation where international economic activities are discouraged.
In short, double taxation occurs when two taxes are applied to the same source of income before it is converted to net income.
## **Understanding Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)**
A Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) is a pact signed by two nations that encourages capital investment, trade in goods and services, and other economic activities between the two nations by preventing International Double Taxation.
This suggests that there are agreed-upon tax rates and jurisdictions for certain types of income that originate in one country and are received by tax residents of another country.
The issue of Double Taxation is connected to the taxation of international income. Depending on the types of businesses/holdings that citizens of one country have in another, the DTAA may either cover all types of income or may focus on a particular type of income. In accordance with the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA), the following categories are covered:
  * Salary
  * [Capital Gains](https://groww.in/p/capital-gains)
  * Services
  * Property
  * Savings
  * Fixed Deposit Accounts


The disparity in [tax](https://groww.in/p/tax) collection on personal income worldwide is the root cause of the need for DTAA. If a person wants to run a business in another nation, he or she may have to pay income taxes in both nations—the one where the income is earned and the one where the person is a citizen or resides.
For instance, if you leave income sources in India and move to a different country, such as interest from deposits, both India and the country where you are currently residing will charge you interest based on your total combined earnings. You might end up paying twice as much tax on the same income in such a situation.
The DTAA helps taxpayers in this situation.
## **Objective of DTAA**
The primary objectives of a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) are:
  * The main purpose of a DTAA is to ensure that income earned by a resident of one country is not taxed twice, once in the country of residence and again in the country where the income is earned.
  * By lowering the tax burden on international transactions, DTAAs encourage businesses and individuals to engage in cross-border trade and investment. 
  * DTAAs offer clear rules and guidelines on how income from various sources will be taxed, providing taxpayers with certainty and stability.
  * DTAAs often include provisions to prevent tax evasion and avoidance by promoting the exchange of information between tax authorities of the contracting countries. This helps detect and address tax fraud and make sure that taxpayers pay their share of taxes.
  * DTAAs enhance cooperation between tax authorities of the contracting countries through mutual agreement procedures (MAP) and exchange of information. This cooperation helps resolve tax disputes and improve the overall effectiveness of tax administration.
  * For developing countries, DTAAs can attract foreign direct investment (FDI) by providing favorable tax treatment, which can contribute to economic development and growth.


## **DTAA Duration and Rates**
These agreements usually remain in effect forever unless and until either party formally terminates them.
Furthermore, depending on the specifics that were agreed upon by both parties, the DTAA rates and regulations change from one country to the next. TDS rates on interest earned range from 7.50% to 15%, but are typically 10% or 15% in most nations.
## **List of Countries Having Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement Treaty with India**

2. **Determine Residency Status** : Establish the tax residency status of the taxpayer in both countries. This is crucial as DTAAs typically apply to residents of one or both of the contracting states.
3. **Type of Income** : Identify the specific type of income in question (e.g., salary, business income, interest, dividends, royalties, capital gains). Different types of income are often treated differently under DTAAs. 
4. **Review the DTAA Provisions** : Obtain the relevant DTAA document. Review the provisions related to the type of income concerned. Key articles to review typically include those on income from employment, business profits, dividends, interest, royalties, and capital gains. Look for definitions, scope, and limitations.
