# IndusInd Avios Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/indusind-avios-credit-card-review

In 2023, IndusInd announced its collaboration with Avios to launch a distinctive multi-branded credit card that shares the same frequent flyer currency, Avios, used by British Airways and Qatar Airways. On July 7th, the IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card officially debuted.

The IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card stands out for its unique approach. Instead of being tied to a single airline, it functions as a multi-brand frequent flyer credit card. Cardholders can select Qatar Airways Privilege Club or British Airways Executive Club as their preferred airline loyalty program. This lets you earn points directly within your partner’s frequent flyer program.

While the distinction might seem minimal—given that Avios can be transferred freely between Qatar Airways Privilege Club and British Airways Executive Club—the real value lies in the differences offered through the welcome bonus. Let’s delve into some key details of the card.

A key factor in maximizing rewards with this card is achieving spending milestones. These milestones significantly boost the overall rewards rate. For instance, spending 16L on the British Airways (BA) variant could yield 113,000 Avios points. This includes 50,000 Avios from the milestone, 8,000 Avios from regular spending, and a 55,000 Avios welcome bonus on the BA Variant.

While Qatar Airways and British Airways are known for higher taxes on flights, this can also make it easier to find award availability compared to airlines with lower taxes.

The IndusInd Bank Avios Credit Card offers a unique benefit: complimentary International Airport meet & greet services across the globe. This service is a rarity among Indian credit cards, providing a truly exclusive travel experience. With meet & greet, you enjoy expedited security and immigration processes, accompanied by airport staff and a porter. This service eliminates the hassle of navigating the airport alone, ensuring a smooth and comfortable journey.

The IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card provides valuable overseas medical insurance coverage of up to USD 25,000 for both the primary cardholder and their spouse (if travelling together) during their international trips. This coverage is valid for up to 60 days per trip and is applicable only when the travel tickets are purchased using the IndusInd Avios Visa Infinite Credit Card.

The offering left me underwhelmed overall, primarily due to the steep annual fee, the low earning rate, and the restrictive tie to a single frequent flyer program—Avios—which is notorious for imposing high taxes and surcharges on passenger bookings. This combination fails to pique my interest. While the card may attract a niche audience enticed by Qatar and OneWorld Elite Status, it holds little appeal for the majority, especially when compared to the far more rewarding credit card options available in the market today. And let’s not overlook the dismal lounge access limits—this seriously needs a rethink, IndusInd!
