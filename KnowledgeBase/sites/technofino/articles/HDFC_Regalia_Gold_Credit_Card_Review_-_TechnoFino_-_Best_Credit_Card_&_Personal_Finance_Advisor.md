Earlier in 2023 HDFC launched Regalia Gold which is an upgraded version of their most popular[HDFC Regalia](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/) credit card. With this, the HDFC Bank has positioned it just below the HDFC luxury twins [HDFC Infinia Credit Card ](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-infinia-credit-card-metal-edition-review/)and HDFC Diners Club Black Credit Card. I have recently taken a plunge into it.
Here’s everything you wish to know about the card.

### Charges and Welcome Benefits
Joining Fees| ₹2500 + GST or FYF (Upgrade)  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| 1) Gift Voucher worth ₹2500 (Paid Cards)2) Complimentary [Club Vistara](https://www.technofino.in/category/loyalty-guides/airline-loyalty-guides/) Silver Tier and MMT Black Elite Membership*  
Renewal Fees| ₹2500 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| NIL  
Renewal Fee Waiver| Spend ₹4L or more in a year.  
  * *Applicable on ₹1L spent within 90 days of card issuance


HDFC has done away with reward points on both welcome and annual benefits on Regalia Gold which I found surprising since its a premium reward points based travel card.
### Reward Points Accrual
Spends Area| Reward Rate| Maximum Capping per Calendar Month  
---|---|---  
All retail***** spends| 4 Reward Points per ₹150 spent (1X)| No capping  
Marks & Spencers, Myntra, Nykaa & Reliance Digital| 20 Reward Points per ₹150 spent (5X)| 5000 per month on 4X accelerated points  
***** Except for Fuel, Rental Payments, Packers and Movers, Government Transactions, Wallet loads, and Easy EMI transactions.
  * Reward points are valid only for **2 years** from the date of accumulation
  * Reward points accrued for **Insurance transactions** will have a maximum cap of **2,000 per day**
  * Reward points accrued for **Grocery transactions** will have a maximum cap of **2,000 per month**


HDFC Bank has a dedicated portal named **[SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/)** with which we get some extra rewards and cashback.
#### **SmartBuy Benefits**
Accelerated Reward Rate| Maximum Reward Points per Calendar Month| Maximum Reward Points per Day  
---|---|---  
Upto 10X| 4000| 2000  
  * It supports merchants like Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, IGP, Apple Tresor, and likes. It also supports multiple partners for travel bookings like IRCTC, RedBus, MMT and Yatra.


### **Reward Points Redemption**
![](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-regalia-gold-credit-card-review/)[HDFC Bank Regalia Gold’s Unified SmartBuy Portal](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com/v1/regaliagold)Modes of Redemption| Value per point| Reward Rate| Redemption Charges  
---|---|---|---  
Exclusive Gold Catalogue(Apple, Samsung, Bose & other vouchers)| 1 RP = ₹0.65| ~1.73(1X)~8.66(5X)~17.33(10X)| ₹99 + GST  
Flights and Hotel bookings via [SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/)| 1 RP = ₹0.5| ~1.33%(1X)~6.65%(5X)~13.3%(10X)| ₹99 + GST  
Products and Vouchers via Netbanking or [SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/)| 1 RP = upto ₹0.35| ~0.93%(1X)~4.65%(5X)~9.3%(10X)| ₹99 + GST  
Cashback (Statement Credit)| 1 RP = ₹0.20| ~0.53%(1X)~2.65%(5X)~5.3%(10X)| None  
Airmiles/Hotel Loyalty Points| 1 RP = up to 0.50 Miles/ Points| Minimum ~1.33%(1X)| None  
Redemption Value Chart.
  * Customers can redeem up to a maximum of 70% on travel bookings (Flights, hotels and experiences) using Reward Points. The balance amount will need to be paid via credit card.


Although the maximum value on paper lies in the redemptions via Gold Catalogue in which you can buy iPhones, Bose products and Samsung phones then you will be missing the instant card discount on the same. The best redemptions on Regalia Gold would be airmiles or hotel redemptions since it comes with a gold partner redemption list or else simply you can go for travel redemptions from the [SmartBuy](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-smartbuy/) portal.
![](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-regalia-gold-credit-card-review/)
We have compiled all the [Airmiles transfer partners](https://www.technofino.in/community/threads/list-of-air-miles-credit-cards-in-india-and-its-transfer-partners.601/) and [hotel loyalty partners](https://www.technofino.in/community/threads/list-of-hotel-loyalty-points-credit-cards-in-india-2022-and-its-transfer-partners.4943/) for Regalia Gold.
### Milestone Benefits
![](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-regalia-gold-credit-card-review/)
  * Get ₹1,500 Gift Voucher from Marriott, Myntra, Marks & Spencer or Reliance Digital when you spend 1.5 Lakhs in every calendar quarter.
  * Get ₹5,000 worth of flight vouchers when you spend ₹5 Lakhs in an anniversary year 
  * Get an additional ₹5,000 worth of flight vouchers when you spend ₹7.5 Lakhs in an anniversary year 
  * An anniversary year is defined as a 12-month period from card setup or the last upgrade/downgrade date.


All these benefits add up to ₹16,000 on a spend of ₹7.5L a year which is approximately 2.1% of additional benefits other than the base rewards.
### Other Benefits
#### Airport Lounge Access
Access Via – Credit Card**Complimentary Domestic Limit** – 12 Visits/ Calendar year within India (Shared between Primary & maximum 3 Add-on cardholders but both cards cannot be used for the same lounge, same day).Network – Visa Signature/ MasterCard World
Access Via – Priority Pass**Complimentary International Limit** – 6 Visits/ Calendar year (Shared between Primary & Add-on cards)
  * You can apply for a Priority Pass for yourself and 3 add-on members once you complete a minimum of four retail transactions on your HDFC Bank Regalia Gold Credit Card.
  * If you exceed the 6 Complimentary visits, you will be charged at US $27 + GST per visit. 


#### Airport Transfers

You have to generate your voucher code and use it in the Uber application for the airport pick-and-drop service. This voucher can be generated a maximum of twice per quarter. Quite a unique and value-oriented feature I must say.

Unofficially, If you are an existing HDFC Credit Cardholder then you can ask for an upgrade if there is a 3L limit on your existing card.
### TechnoFino Recommends
HDFC Regalia Gold Credit Card is definitely a highly rewarding and lifestyle credit card and is also the gateway to the HDFC twins. With an upgraded list of transfer partners, travel vouchers and complimentary airport transfers this card surely packs a lot of punch.
Since many LTF [Regalia](https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-regalia-credit-card-review/) holders have already received an upgrade invite to FYF Regalia Gold I would recommend them to take the plunge and enjoy the shining new card and the host of benefits that it has to offer over its predecessor.

Can you compare rewards with regalia rewards? Gold card is not LTF where many of them including me are enjoying regalia LTF CC. Once we move to Gold then annual charges are there.
