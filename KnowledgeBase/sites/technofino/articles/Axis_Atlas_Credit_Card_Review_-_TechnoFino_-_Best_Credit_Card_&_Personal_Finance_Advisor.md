Some find this card super-worthy and others complicated. Read on to know all about this card and let all your doubts fade away!

## Charges and Welcome Benefits
Joining Fees| ₹5000 + GST  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| 2500 Edge Miles  
Renewal Fees| ₹5000 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| As per the tier system given below.  
Renewal Fee Waiver| NA  
  * Welcome benefits will be credited within 60 days from the date the third transaction is completed within 60 days of the card being set up.


## Reward Accrual
Since Axis Bank is new to the miles game, they have started rewarding this card differently. Instead of the usual EDGE rewards, you are entitled to EDGE Miles on this card.
Spends Area| Reward Rate  
---|---  
Airlines & AXIS EDGE Travel Portal| **5 EDGE Miles/ ₹100** till **₹** 2L per Calendar Month**2 EDGE Miles/ ₹100** for spends above **₹** 2L per Calendar Month  
All Retail Spends*|  **2 EDGE Mile/ ₹100**  
  * *Excluding spending on Wallet, Gold, Jewellery, Rent, Insurance, Govt. Institutions, Utilities and Fuel


## Tier and Milestone Benefits
Axis has shown some great innovation in the reward system of this card by introducing what they call a “Tier” system. In this the more you spend the more rewarding this card becomes.
  * Initially, everyone who gets this card gets an exclusive Silver Tier.
  * Now as you spend more in your anniversary year you get an upgrade to Gold and Platinum Tiers.


  * In an anniversary year, when you hit **₹7.5L** of spending, you get upgraded to the **Gold Tier** , and when you spend beyond **₹15L** , you get upgraded to the **Platinum Tier.**
  * The Tier and Milestone calculations exclude spends done on Wallet, Gold, Jewellery, Rent, Insurance, Govt. Institutions, Utilities and Fuel
  * Other than this meeting the following spends you get the following additional miles.

**Spends**|  ₹3L| ₹7.5L| ₹15L  
---|---|---|---  
**Milestone Benefits**|  2500 EDGE Miles| +2500 EDGE Miles = Total 5000 EDGE Miles| +5,000EDGE Miles = Total 10,000 EDGE Miles  
### Tier Change
Atlas credit cardholders’ tier will be evaluated at the beginning of each anniversary year based on the previous year’s card spending. But tier upgrades are being provided basis the spending in the middle of the year.
For example, if you get your card on 1st April 2022 and start with a Silver Tier and you spend ₹15L within let’s say 3 months then you get upgraded to Platinum Tier from that very same time and continue to enjoy it next year also. But if you fail to make the necessary spending in the year 2023-24 then you will be downgraded to Silver or Gold depending upon the spending you have achieved.
## Reward Redemption
Redemption Option| Redemption Value  
---|---  
Booking flights/hotels on [Travel EDGE Portal](https://traveledge.axisbank.co.in/ "Travel EDGE Portal")| 1 EDGE Mile = ₹1  
Miles Transfer| 1 EDGE Mile = Up to 2 Partner Airmiles  
AXIS ATLAS redemption chart.
Overall the reward rates on this card are a bit low when redeemed for flights and hotels via the AXIS Travel EDGE portal since if we consider milestone benefits the overall reward rate comes out to be around 2% only.
However, the real value of this card can only be utilized when it is used to transfer air miles to partner airlines. Since the partner airlines keep on changing so I am attaching the link where we listed all the [transfer partners](https://www.technofino.in/community/threads/list-of-air-miles-credit-cards-in-india-2022-and-its-transfer-partners.601/) on the TechnoFino Community.
**TechnoFino Tip** – Even if you still wish to do it then first transfer it to [Club ITC](https://www.technofino.in/club-itc-the-ultimate-guide/) and then transfer it to Bonvoy to get a 1 Edge Miles is to 3 Marriot Bonvoy points value with a maximum transfer capping of 10K points per quarter.
## Renewal Benefits
There is no fee waiver condition on this card so it tries to compensate it with milestone and annual benefits.
Tier| Silver| Gold| Platinum  
---|---|---|---  
Renewal Benefits| –| 2500 EDGE Miles| 5,000 EDGE Miles  
  * Above mentioned EDGE Mileswill be credited to cardholders’ EDGE Miles accounts upon successful payment of the card renewal fees as per the tier achieved on the anniversary date.


## Travel Benefits
Benefit\Tier| Silver| Gold| Platinum  
---|---|---|---  
Complimentary Airport Lounge Access – Domestic| 8| 12| 18  
Complimentary Airport Lounge Access – International| 4| 6| 12  
  * The lounge access limits are fully sharable across guests is another great feature of ATLAS.
  * International lounge access on Axis Atlas credit card is provided via Dreamfolks.
  * Following the recent devaluation, the Axis Atlas Credit Card no longer includes airport transfers or meet-and-greet services.


## Surcharges
### Forex Markup Charges
  * Forex Markup charges are standard 3.50% + GST


## TechnoFino Recommends
Atlas is overall a very good product if you like playing with the miles since direct redemption won’t give you much value. As mentioned in the beginning this card may prove to be complicated for someone who tries to chase the rewards by doing a back calculation before spending. That said, this card belongs to someone who has regular spending of at least ₹7.5LPA since below this threshold the reward rate is quite average. Further, consider this only if you are a lot into travelling._What are your thoughts on the new Axis Atlas credit card?

What if my spend is only 2.5L in the 1st year. Without hitting the Silver Tier threshold of 3L, would I be eligible for the annual renewal benefits of 2.5K Edge Miles + Lounge benefits of Silver Tier?
And what would be my Tyre in the 2nd year if I don’t hit the Silver Tyre Threshold of 3L in the 1st year?

Do we get Atlas Edge miles for payment made on the Adda app towards Apartment maintenance changes. Adda charges a 2.7% charge on credit card payment and it doesn’t support Diner/Amex, so only option is VISA/Master and I don’t want to give it 2.7% unless I can get 2% back from the card and also move towards spend based benefits
