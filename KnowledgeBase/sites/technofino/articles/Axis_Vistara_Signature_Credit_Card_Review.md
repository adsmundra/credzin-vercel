# Axis Vistara Signature Credit Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/axis-vistara-signature-credit-card

Axis Vistara Signature credit card is the middle variant among the three credit cards that Axis is having in partnership with Vistara.  Vistara for the first time in India had coined a new configuration that is Premium Economy. In this you get a Business class like experience on an economy-sized seat at almost 1.5-2X the economy prices.

This card gives you milestone benefits in the form of Premium Economy tickets. Read on to know the benefits, how you can maximize them, and also whether there are better alternatives available or not!

This premium economy ticket voucher covers 2X-3X of the joining fees and even the renewal fees payment so I can clearly say that this card is better than an LTF credit card. Since even if you are flying economy the average ticket price is above 5K if booked a month ago but this card gives you a PEY ticket in just ₹3,000 + GST.

This card has decent CV points earning rates among all the Vistara Cobrand credit cards on generic spending. Axis has excluded fuel spending from the reward structure butSBI Vistara Primeoffers CV points even on fuel spending which makes it a lucrative fuel card also.

Just like all other Vistara co-branded cards, the real value of this card lies in its milestone benefits.

Voucher usage conditions remain the same as that of the welcome voucher as I have mentioned above. I have done a value analysis of these vouchers later on in this article.

Clearly going for the ₹9L milestone makes no sense so better aim for that₹4.5L milestoneto maximize your benefits. So if you hit that ₹4.5L milestone then you will get

With12K CV points, you can get an economy Delhi-Mumbai return flight worth ₹12K.  The3 premium economy flight vouchers are worth a minimum of ₹8K eacheven if we are taking a conservative value like for the Delhi-Bengaluru flight. One one-class upgrade voucher has a value of 5-10K depending which upgrade you take. Even if we factor in the taxes the equivalent reward comes out to be around ₹35K for ₹4.5L of spends and the equivalentreward rateis agood 7.5%!

The value gets enhanced more since you can also use these vouchers and points for yourfamily and friendsby adding them as a nominee in your Club Vistara Account. Also, you don’t pay any convenience fee for the booking from their official site.

But if you believe in traveling economy and getting the cheapest fare then you will value it very differently.

One gets a complimentaryVistara CV Silver membershiptill you hold an active card which offers you a host of benefits likepriority boarding, priority check-in, 5Kg extra baggage allowance, and likes.

It also gives you 9 Club Vistara Points/Tier Points for every ₹100 that you spend on Vistara flights.

Cover of 300$ for the following.

If you regularly travel via flights then you can consider shifting your loyalty to Vistara if your city is serviced by them. This switch will be very easy if you are living in Delhi and Mumbai or even Bengaluru since they are the hub of Vistara.

Now talking about this card, if you are looking for a Premium Economy experience then I would preferSBI Vistara Primesince it gives a better value than this card as it gives you Yatra Voucher worth ₹10K and a Premium Economy voucher extra on crossing ₹8L milestone. If we compare only the ₹4.5L milestone still SBI variant is better since it rewards fuel transactions also. From the Axis stable, the only Vistara card I like isAxis Vistara Infinitefor its unique feature of Business Class Vouchers as milestone benefits.
