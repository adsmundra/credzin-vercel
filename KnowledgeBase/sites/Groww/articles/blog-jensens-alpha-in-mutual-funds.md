**Jensen’s Alpha** is a measure that is used to evaluate/analyse the performance of any investment portfolio relative to a benchmark index. It helps calculate the excess return that is generated by the portfolio over the anticipated return and this is predicted by the CAPM (capital asset pricing model).
To simplify it, it basically measures the excess/abnormal returns of any investment in comparison to its estimated returns. This makes it a great option for evaluating mutual funds and many other types of assets. It also takes into account the average portfolio/investment market return and the beta. 
The formula has transformed into a crucial tool for investors to measure risk-adjusted excess return of mutual funds and whether the average returns are acceptable in comparison to the prevailing risks. Let’s learn more about it below. 
## **Jensen’s Alpha Formula and Calculation**
Before deploying the **Jensen’s Alpha formula** , a basic understanding of Alpha and Beta will always be handy. 
Here is the formula to calculate Jensen’s Alpha - 
α=Rp−[Rf+β(Rm−Rf)]\alpha = R_p - [ R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f) ]α=Rp​−[Rf​+β(Rm​−Rf​)]
Where, 
  * RpR_pRp​ = Mutual fund return
  * RfR_fRf​ = Risk-free rate (e.g., U.S. Treasury yield)
  * β\betaβ = Fund’s beta (market risk sensitivity)
  * RmR_mRm​ = Market return


In simple terms, you can **calculate Jensen’s Alpha** by deploying this formula. The actual portfolio/mutual fund return is the return that it has achieved over a particular timeline. The risk-free rate means a return from a risk-free investment (in theory) like Government bonds.
The portfolio/fund beta is the measure of the sensitivity of the portfolio to market movements. You can also call it market risk sensitivity. The market return is the overall returns over the same timeline. 
So, what you have to do is subtract the anticipated portfolio return (as calculated by the [CAPM](https://groww.in/p/capital-asset-pricing-model)) from the actual return. This value indicates the excess return over what was anticipated, given the risk level.
A positive alpha is an indicator of the portfolio outperforming the market, while a negative alpha is an indicator of underperformance.
Let’s consider a **Jensen’s alpha calculation example** for more clarity. 
Let us assume that the risk-free rate is 6% and that the mutual fund has realised a return of 15%, with the beta being 1.2 for the same index while the approximate index has returned 12%.
In this case, the **Jensen’s Alpha** calculation would be - 
15 - [6 + 1.2 * (12 – 6)] = 1.8%. 
## **Interpreting Jensen’s Alpha in Mutual Funds**
Now that you have an idea of the calculation process, knowing how to interpret Jensen’s Alpha is essential in order to evaluate mutual funds better. The implications are the following: 
  * **Positive Alpha** - In case the alpha is positive, it is a clear indicator of the mutual fund outperforming the benchmark or market (risk-adjusted basis)
  * **Negative Alpha** - In this case, the mutual fund is clearly underperforming the benchmark or benchmark
  * **Zero Alpha** - This means that the mutual fund performance is in line with anticipated returns based on the beta


Let us now look at why it matters while evaluating mutual funds. 
## **Why Jensen’s Alpha is Important for Mutual Fund Investors**
Jensen’s Alpha calculations are crucial for mutual fund investors. Here’s why: 
  * It is an important metric for evaluating mutual funds and comparing them. This will help us understand which one has done better based on returns relative to its [benchmark](https://groww.in/p/benchmark) index. 


This is helpful in comparing passive index funds to actively managed funds. The anticipated return measure is through the CAPM. You can thus determine whether the mutual fund price conforms to the expected return by taking risk and the TVM (time value of money) into account. 
  * You can also evaluate historical performance of a fund and overall consistency, along with how the investment manager is doing. The overall return in addition to the risk of a portfolio can be tracked to see whether the return compensates for the risk that is being taken. 


For instance, if two mutual funds have a return of 10%, investors will naturally gravitate towards the less risky one. The Jensen’s Alpha measure is a way to work out whether the portfolio is getting the right return for its risk level, i.e. if the value is positive. 
  * You can also compare investment performance across multiple funds through a standardised risk-adjusted return measure. 


## **Jensen’s Alpha vs. Other Performance Metrics**
Now it’s time to assess how Jensen’s Alpha stacks up against other performance metrics for investments. This will help you get the answer to the **Jensen’s Alpha vs. Sharpe ratio** debate, while pitting the former against the Treynor ratio as well.
[**Sharpe Ratio**](https://groww.in/p/sharpe-ratio) |  [**Treynor Ratio**](https://groww.in/p/treynor-ratio) |  **Jensen’s Alpha**  
---|---|---  
Measures the return per unit of total risk (volatility)  |  Measures the return per unit of systematic risk (beta) |  Measures the excess return over the anticipated return or performance relative to a benchmark index.   
Defined as portfolio risk premium divided by the portfolio risk  |  It is an extension of the Sharpe ratio, although total risk is not used. Instead, beta or systematic risk is the key denominator |  It actually subtracts the anticipated portfolio return from the actual return  
It is the slope of the capital allocation line (CAL). The greater this slope, the better the asset |  It is more suited for those with diversified portfolios  |  It thus focuses on the skill of the fund manager in generating excess returns  
The risk used is the total portfolio risk and not the systematic risk, which is a limitation. The ratio is not informative by itself and you have to calculate the ratio for each portfolio and rank portfolios accordingly |  Positive numerators are necessary for getting comparative results that are meaningful and it does not function for negative beta assets  |  There are challenges in accurate estimation of beta while it may not always reflect future performance  
Another limitation is when there are negative numerators. So, the Sharpe ratio in such a scenario will be less negative for a portfolio that is riskier, i.e. leading to rankings that are incorrect  |  While it can also rank portfolios, it does not offer information on whether a portfolio is better than the market portfolio  |  CAPM is the core foundation of the measure, which makes several market assumptions. If these do not hold properly, then the performance measure may not be reliable   
## **Limitations of Using Jensen’s Alpha in Mutual Funds**
Jensen’s Alpha, while being a useful tool for investors, has its share of limitations as well. Some of them include: 
  * It is a historical measure that is based on past returns. Hence, while it can offer knowledge of the past performance of any investment/fund, it is not a predictor of how it will perform in the future. You should not thus depend solely on it for your investment decisions. 
  * There are challenges in accurate estimation of beta, while the measure is based on the CAPM. This makes several market assumptions, including that it is efficient, all investors have the same expectations regarding returns, and there are zero taxes/transaction costs. If these variables do not hold true, then performance cannot be estimated accurately. 
  * Jensen’s Alpha measures fund performance relative to the benchmark without offering insights on the absolute performance, while the choice of benchmark selection can impact the calculation considerably. 
  * The measure assumes that excess returns are due to the fund manager’s skills to earn excess returns. Yet, there are several factors impacting performance including fees, luck, and conditions in the market. Hence, solely depending on the same while evaluating the skills of managers is not wise. 


## **Conclusion**
**Jensen’s Alpha** is a useful measure/tool that you can use to gain insights about the performance of any [mutual fund](https://groww.in/mutual-funds), assess the fund manager’s ability in outperforming the benchmark, and compare fund performance before making an investment decision. However, it does have its limitations and you cannot depend solely on it for decision-making. On that note, here’s to leveraging your knowledge of this evaluation tool en route towards investing in strategic mutual funds for your portfolio.
