AI offers many opportunities to help people work better and improve their lives. It is used in various ways to change how businesses operate. In 2018, India spent a lot, around US$ 665 million, on AI, and it is expected to grow even more, reaching US$ 11,781 million by 2025.
India has a long history with AI, and its market has grown exponentially in recent decades. AI systems have become more important because they can create economic value and solve social problems. The adoption and development of AI have increased a lot lately. A report by NITI Aayog in 2018 said that AI could add $957 billion to India's economy by 2035.
AI is useful in many sectors like education, agriculture and healthcare. It can help with things like precision farming advice or remote medical diagnosis.
