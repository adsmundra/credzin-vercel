Amazon is one of the few brands that every person on this planet who has ever used the internet is aware of. But what is Amazon? Is it just an e-commerce giant? Or a retail service provider? To be fair, Amazon is an amalgamation of businesses that defy all norms. It has grown to a scale that it is impossible to imagine how it manages to maintain its service standards even today. There is a lot more to Amazon than what meets the eye.
Most people know that Amazon is an e-commerce behemoth. However, from an online single-cell bookseller to having almost every product under the sun, it has come a long way. Here is a look at the journey of this mega-brand:
## **1994**
Jeff Bezos launched an online bookstore in July 1994 called Amazon from the garage of his rented home in Washington. He had a vision of making the company “ _An Everything Store_.” A visionary and entrepreneur at heart, Bezos started Amazon when he was 30 years old.
_Jeff Bezos had initially thought of naming the company ‘Cadabra’ (think abracadabra). However, his lawyer convinced him that the name sounded more like ‘cadaver’ (corpse). Hence, the name was dropped. Bezos then thought of naming the company ‘Relentless’. Finally, he decided on Amazon as the largest river in the world. By the way, if you type_ _www.relentless.com_ _, guess where you will land!_
Initially, Amazon’s sales were limited to word-of-mouth publicity only. In fact, for the first few orders, Bezos and his employees used to drive down to the post offices to deliver the packages themselves.
## **1996**
Bezos reincorporated the company in Delaware. Its customer base grew to around 1.8 lakh with annual revenues of around $16 million.
## **1997**
By 1997, the company’s annual revenues had seen a massive jump to $148 million. Amazon was still a private company. However, Bezos realized that he needed more funds to sustain the long-term trajectory and decided to go public. On May 15, 1997, Amazon issued an IPO at $18 per share under the symbol AMZN on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The IPO raised $54 million.
_Just before the listing, Barnes & Noble sued Amazon alleging that Amazon’s claim of being the world’s largest bookstore was false since it was a book broker and not a bookstore. It was settled out of court and Amazon continued making the claim. _
_This year, Amazon also delivered its one-millionth order. This was a buyer in Japan who had purchased a Windows NT machine and the biography of Princess Diana. Jeff Bezos personally delivered this to the buyer._
## **May 15, 1997**
AMZN: Listed at $18 per share
After adjusting for a few stock splits, the stock finally closed at $1.96 on its first trading day.
## **1998: Amazon Expands into Music and Computer Games**
In 1998, Amazon included music and computer games to the list of products offered via its online store. The music section was launched with around 125,000 titles which was far more than what a brick and mortar music store offered. Also, people could listen to clips before buying and get recommendations based on their mood.
## **June 11, 1998**
AMZN: $10.42 per share
## **1999**
By 1999, Amazon had already expanded into selling video games, home-improvement items, consumer electronics software, games, and much more. Bezos wanted to catch up with his motto of “get big fast”. By the end of the year, Amazon had shipped to around 150 countries around the globe. It was shaping into a global online store.
_The Times Magazine named Jeff Bezos Person of the Year in 1999._
## **December 10, 1999**
AMZN: $106.69 per share
Amazon peaked at this value by the end of 1999. It did survive the dot-com bubble but the stock price was not completely safe from the crash as it did fall a bit after that
## **2000 & 2001**
In 2000, Amazon started permitting individual sellers and merchants to sell their products next to its own items. Further, there was a change in Amazon’s logo with the curved arrow featuring from A to Z. This was a representation of the fact that Amazon now carries all products from A to Z with a smile (the arrow curved like a smile). However, the company did not start churning profits until late 2001. The beginning of the 21st century brought with it the dot-com bubble. While it destroyed many e-commerce companies, Amazon grew past it and became one of the biggest names in online sales. 
## **December 21, 2000**
AMZN: 15.56 per share
This was a major drop from the previous year’s high of over $106.
## **September 28, 2001**
AMZN: $5.97 per share
This was the lowest it had dropped since the IPO.
## **2002**
By 2002 Amazon also started venturing into clothing. It announced a partnership with several clothing companies and started offering more than 400 brands online. It also introduced ‘ _Free Super Saver Shipping_ ’ that allowed buyers to avail of free shipping for orders above $99.
## **November 25, 2002**
AMZN: $24.25 per share
## **2003**
In 2003, Amazon stepped foot outside retailing and launched Amazon Web Services (AWS). This eventually became an engine that generated huge profits for the company and supported its e-commerce expansion activities in the future. It also started leasing its platform to other eCommerce sites like target.com, borders.com, etc.

### **July 15, 2019**
AMZN: $2,020.99 per share
## **2020**
While this year has been tough on economies and individuals around the globe due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, the rise in online purchases and home deliveries as opposed to going to physical stores has seen Amazon cross the $1.5 trillion market capitalization mark.

AMZN: $3,531.45 per share
## **Summing Up**
In 1997, Amazon had launched shares at $18 per share. Today, the price has crossed $3,500. So, if someone would have invested $10,000 in Amazon’s IPO, it would be worth around $19 million today (in 23 years). While Amazon did ride the digitization and globalization wave optimally, it also ensured that it stayed ahead of the race and kept innovating constantly. A global company and a great company to invest in, Amazon is truly a brand that resonates with success and growth.
