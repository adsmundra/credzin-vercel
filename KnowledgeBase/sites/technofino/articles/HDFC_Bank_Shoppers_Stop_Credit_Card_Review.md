Source: https://www.technofino.in/hdfc-bank-shoppers-stop-credit-card-review

HDFC Bank, the no. 1 player in the credit card segment has partnered with the retail giant Shoppers Stop, one of the leading departmental stores in India. Only recently RBI gave permission to HDFC Bank for new launches and as hinted earlier by them about a variety of partnerships in the pipeline, these cards are amongst the first ones to be announced. With Citibank exiting Indian market which was having a card in partnership with Shoppers Stop there may be some takers for this card.

There are two variants of these HDFC Bank Shoppers Stop co-branded credit cards: one is the entry-level Shoppers Stop Credit Card and the other is the premium version called Shoppers Stop Black. Here’s everything you need to know about them.

It’s an unconditional LTF card from HDFC Bank. The welcome voucher is equivalent to a 10% discount on shopping and is really very abysmal.

With this card, you get one of the Shoppers Stop loyalty membership out of the five plans that they have except the Shoppers Stop Black. Though nothing clearly is mentioned in the T&C which membership will be provided to the cardholder. There is a provision for earning additional First Citizen Points as per the membership tier you hold with Shoppers Stop.

Earn 2000 First Citizen Points on spending ₹2 Lakhs annually.

1% fuel surcharge waiver of up to ₹250 per statement cycle, across all fuel stations in India.

For Salaried Indian NationalAge: Min 21 years & Max 60 Years,Net Monthly Income> Rs 20,000

For Self Employed Indian nationalAge: Min 21 yrs & Max 65 YrsIncome: ITR > ₹6 Lakhs per annum

The joining fee is too high for the benefits provided on this card. The vouchers provided are a big joke as compared to the huge fees charged. Plus there is no mention of any renewal benefits or even milestone benefits which is a huge disappointment. They could have done a lot better as the wow factor is missing.

With this card, you get it’s one of the highest tier memberships known as First Citizen Black which bumps up your reward rate by another 6% on spends done on all the brands on Shoppers Stop. It gives 20 additional First Citizen Reward Points per ₹200 spends on Shoppers Stop.

Complimentary Domestic Limit– 16 Visits/Year within India (4 Visits/Qtr.).Complimentary International Limit– 8 Visits/Year within India (2 Visits/Qtr.).

1% fuel surcharge waiver of up to ₹500 per statement cycle, across all fuel stations in India.

For salaried Indian nationalAge: Min 21 years & Max 60 Years,Net Monthly Income> ₹2,00,000

For self-employed Indian nationalAge: Min 21 yrs & Max 65 YrsIncome: ITR > ₹8 Lakhs per annum

First of all opting for a co-brand card makes no sense if you are not a heavy shopper of that particular brand so go for these cards only if you do lakhs worth of shopping from Shoppers Stop every year. Further, since HDFC Bank doesn’t allow multi-carding so if you are an existing HDFC Credit card holder then you will have to give up the card for getting this card. I am unable to understand why brands are doing partnerships with HDFC Bank since hardly anyone would anyone give up their current card for a co-branded card. This is similar to the Ka-ching credit card story in which Indigo finally had to partner with Kotak Bank.

Their basic card makes no sense if you have any other HDFC credit card since you will be able to buy vouchers at a better reward rate from HDFC SmartBuy. For the black card, I would suggest you do the maths of the benefits that you won’t be getting on the HDFC card you will be surrendering and the benefits you will be getting on this card.
