Since its inception, the Nifty 50 has become almost synonymous with the Indian stock market. People use the index as an indicator of what is happening in the market and the overall mood of investors.
But it is certainly not the only one. There are several other indices that can be used as indicators of the Indian capital market. Nifty Total Market Index, for instance, is another popular index for a broader overview.
While Nifty 50 showcases the 50 largest companies by market capitalisation, Nifty Total Market Index goes beyond. It covers the top 750 companies in the Indian stock market, ranging across the large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap segments.
So, how do these two indices measure up against each other? Let’s find out!
## **Components and Constituents**
As you can imagine, there are certain overlaps in the constituents of the two indices.
Nifty 50 contains the 50 largest companies in the Indian stock market by market cap, and Nifty Total Market contains the top 750 companies by market cap. This means all the companies included in Nifty 50 are also included in the Nifty Total Market Index. But the weightage of each company is different for each index.
Here, we have broken down the top ten constituents of both the Nifty 50 and the Nifty Total Market Index by weightage.
## **Top Constituents of the Nifty 50 by Weightage**
**Company’s Name** |  **Weight in Nifty 50 (%)** |  **Weight in Nifty Total Market (%)**  
---|---|---  
HDFC Bank Ltd. |  13.77 |  8.52  
Reliance Industries Ltd. |  9.56 |  5.92  
ICICI Bank Ltd. |  7.87 |  4.87  
Infosys Ltd. |  6.01 |  3.72  
ITC Ltd. |  4.55 |  2.82  
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. |  4.04 |  2.50  
Larsen & Toubro Ltd. |  3.84 |  2.37  
Axis Bank Ltd. |  3.13 |  1.94  
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. |  3.04 |  1.88  
Hindustan Unilever Ltd. |  2.63 |  1.63  
_Source: NSE (Data as on 31 August 2023)_
## **Representation and Coverage Comparison**
Nifty 50 represents about 62% of the total free float market capitalisation of all the companies listed on the National Stock Exchange as of September 30, 2022. 
The [Nifty Total Market Index](https://groww.in/p/what-is-nifty-total-market-index), as you can imagine, covers much more than that. At any point, it includes all the stocks that make up the Nifty 500 and the Nifty Microcap 250 indices. Hence, it definitely offers a broader representation. 
For instance, Nifty 50 includes only large-cap stocks, while Nifty Total Market includes the entire range from large-caps to microcaps. Because of the larger number of stocks, it also includes more diversification in terms of the sectors included. Nifty 50 leans more towards financial services and IT, while the Total Market Index provides a more varied [portfolio](https://groww.in/p/portfolio).

## **Historical Performance Analysis**
Both [Nifty 50](https://groww.in/indices/nifty) and Nifty Total Market have shown consistent growth in the past. Nifty 50 has shown an average annual price growth of 11.21% since inception, while Nifty Total Market has grown by about 12.99% in price.
Here's a closer look at their growth numbers:

Please keep in mind, however, that this growth is not linear. The [stock market](https://groww.in/stocks) is volatile, to say the least, and the indices reflect this in terms of price action. There may be periods of up-trend or down-trend. 
During the COVID-19 crisis, for instance, the stock market experienced a significant fall. Nifty 50 faced a major setback reducing to 1,135.20 points, which was a decrease of 12.98%. This brought the index to a close of 7,610.25, marking one of its worst performances in history.
## **Comparison Summary**
Here's how the Nifty Total Market Index and Nifty 50 stack up against each other:

## **Implications for Investors**
For investors, both indices offer a snapshot of the Indian stock market.
Nifty Total Market provides a broader view, covering companies of all sizes across various sectors. It is ideal for a highly diversified approach, spreading across market caps and sectors. In contrast, Nifty 50 focuses only on the large caps. These are the biggest companies in the Indian stock market and the most important market drivers.
The choice depends on the purpose of the investor. If they want a complete snapshot, the Nifty Total Market Index is the answer. But, if they want a representative sample, the Nifty 50 can fit the purpose.
## **Conclusion**
Since their inception, both Nifty Total Market and Nifty 50 have cemented their place in the lives of investors. They have emerged as important indicators of what is happening in the stock market.
Whether you're looking for broad exposure or focusing on the top players, the key lesson is to understand your investment goals and align them with the appropriate index.
