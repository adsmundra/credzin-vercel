Source: https://www.technofino.in/rbl-bank-paisa-on-demand-credit-card-review

RBL Bank Paisa On Demand Credit Card is another credit line card from RBL Bank’s stable in association with PaisaBazaar. The bank is very aggressively launching such credit line cards in recent times to increase their loan books. Though this card is a paid card as per RBL Bank’s website but is being issued as Life Time Free via Paisabazaar website. Due to the same, there is a lot of noise over all our communication channels about this card. So on everyone’s request, I am bringing this review for you. So let’s check out what’s in the store.

*Except Fuel spends.

RBL Bank reward points can be redeemed on their dedicated portalRBL Rewards Portalbut they have the worst reward rates in the credit card industry. They give the most value on travel redemptions but with such poor accrual rates. I hardly doubt that anyone will be able to redeem something meaningful out of the reward points.

Milestone benefits of this card are not up to the mark but as per RBL Bank’s standard still on a better side. I don’t think anyone will be able to hit the milestone spends on this card as RBL tie-ups in sales and promotional offers are very rarely seen.

Even in your dreams if you hit the milestone then also the effective reward rate would be 1% that too if the points are used for travel redemptions. Are you kidding me? Keep it inside a drawer. I hope you have better cards with yourself at your disposal.

This card is a dual credit card that comes with a credit line in collaboration with PaisaBazaar. You can use this card in both ways that is like a credit card or as a credit line. They offer you an instant fund transfer facility with the following features.

Get1+1 freemovie tickets (Up to ₹200/-) on BookMyShow once a month for Weekend shows. This is mostly a standard offering on most of the RBL Cards but mostly I find that the tickets quota is full.

Waiver of fuel surcharge up to₹100/monthfor fuel transactions between ₹500 and ₹4000.

These are a few criteria decided for this card by RBL Bank.

The Customer Services team is available seven days a week, 24 hours a day. The customer care experience of RBL Bank is not up to the mark and the bank doesn’t even seem to care about it.

Such LTF cards are beneficial when it comes to festive sales and other promotional offers from time to time. So if you are an LTF card collector then I see no harm in going for this card. Except for this, I can’t even think of suggesting to you a single reason to get hold of it as the reward rates are so pathetic.If you are really keen to hold an RBL card then I would suggest RBL Zomato or even theRBL ETMoney LoanPassover this card. I see no point in going for an LTF card if there are better benefits cards available from the same bank. In this way, you will at least reap some monthly benefits and have an RBL card in your kitty.

Are you having any RBL credit card in your wallet or are you maintaining a good distance from this bank?Share your thoughts with us in the comments.
