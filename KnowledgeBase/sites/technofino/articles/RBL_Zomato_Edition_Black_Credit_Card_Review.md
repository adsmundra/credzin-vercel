RBL Bank has started issuing Zomato Edition Black again after the embargo was lifted from the MasterCard network. Currently, you can get an upgrade to this card only if you are holding aZomato Edition Classic, and is not an easy task.

Read on to find out whether you should apply for this card after the recent devaluations!

Clearly, this card is too bad when it comes to renewal and welcome benefits, absolutely no value is given back in the form of Edition Cash. Even RBL Bank is offering better joining benefits onZomato Edition Classic. With an increased annual fee waiver condition this card has lost its charm.

After this recent mindless devaluation, I am surprised to see that they have left not much difference between Classic and Black cards. With no 2% cashback on offline spending and 10% on offline dining, this card is certainly not worth the fee being asked for. But even after the recent devaluation, the reward structure is still very aggressive for a bank like RBL. With 1% Edition Cash on online spending, it is still better than most of the cards of RBL Bank.

A10% reward rate on offline dining spendingis alsoquite lucrative.But the real reason why this card is the most sought one currently is its birthday offer, a flat 10% reward on all the spending is just too good to be true. Let’s see till when this offer will sustain till then carpe diem!All gone now!

Edition cash can be converted to Zomato credits in a click and can be used instantly for ordering food and can be combined with available discount coupons, which makes it even more rewarding.

This is a great product from RBL Bank and they can capture a good market with this card. But they need to make the upgrades and application process smoother and more transparent and also sort out the cashback issues at the earliest.

This benefit is anothernominal additionto the existing reward structure that jacksup the reward rate by 0.4%. Not surprised to see this at all as here also the Zomato Edition Classic gives better milestone benefits than this card!

Currently, you get an annualZomato Pro Plusmembershipwhich gets renewed annually as long as you hold this card which gives youunlimited free deliveries. But since Zomato has stopped giving Pro Plus memberships to customers anymore it has been excluded from the card offering in the future and will last till your current membership is active. Nevertheless, the benefits of this membership (except free delivery) are for namesake these days as Zomato is out of competition as compared to mouth-watering offers available on Dineout andEazyDiner Prime.

Domestic Airport Lounge Access: The Card Member will get 2 complimentary visits/quarter in a tie-up with the Mastercard network.

International Airport Lounge Access:The Cardmember will also get 2 complimentary visits/year, with Priority Pass, which is available upon request.

The cardmember will get1 movie ticket free on purchase of 1 movie ticket at BookMyShow, once a month. The maximum discount amount will be INR. 200/- per transaction.

The Card Member will be eligible for alow forex markup of 1.50%on all international transactions which is quite competitive.

Check out the money tab on your Zomato application and apply for Edition Classic Card first. Zomato has already given invites to the masses but if you are still to get an invite you can refer to the steps given on theTechnoFino Communityherefor an invite. Now you can try and ask RBL for an upgrade to Zomato Edition Black. We have compiled all the required stepsherefor the upgrade.

The upgrade has not been smooth for many people as per the general feedback that I have received. Though the upgrade has been easier for people having a good relationship with RBL Bank.

RBL Bank has recently devalued this card so much that there is not a single reason I can suggest you for holding this card. If you are having an LTF version of this card which is very rare to be seen then continue to use it on merchant offers till you find a more suitable RBL credit card for your spending needs. And it simply makes no sense to get a paid version of this card now.

Instead, you can exploreAxis Airtel,IndusInd Eazy Dinerand AU Bank Zenith which are currently giving the best rewards on food delivery and dining. And if you are holding other premium cards then don’t bother about this card.
