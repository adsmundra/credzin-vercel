# AMEX Gold Charge Card Review

Source: https://www.technofino.in/amex-gold-charge-card-review

American Express has finally started issuing cards since they were put under an embargo by the RBI. Their most sought entry-level card other than theAMEX Membership Rewardsis theAMEX Gold Charge Card. In my opinion, the Gold Charge card is even more rewarding than the MRCC. But wait did I tell you why it’s called a Charge Card and not a Credit Card?

A Charge Card works like a Credit Card, but without offering the option of making part payment. You are required to pay your charge card bill in full by the due date. Charge Cards offer a “no pre-set” spending limit. But this doesn’t mean that you can spend an unlimited amount using a charge card as AMEX does have an internal limit on this card which is not revealed upfront to the customer.

Now that you know what a charge card is then let’s check out how we can maximize rewards on it!

Contents

AMEX doesn’t give you a spends-based fee waiver on Gold Charge Cards but you may get a waiver (unofficially over ₹2-₹4Lakh spends annually) or a retention offer to keep you in the loop. Especially if you hold other AMEX cards then AMEXvalues the overall relationship. Otherwise,you can get an MRCC as a companion card whenever AMEX offers you which makes MRCC free and the fee you pay for Gold Charge becomes shared.

Application through referral is a clear-cut winner due to the extra 4000 bonus points. Since everything else is the same then why lose the extra 4000 MR points? Check out the link for detailed referral benefits information.

If you face any problems in the application process you can contact me onTechnofino Community.

You can choose to apply for any AMEX card from the link in the banner. To choose and apply a card of your choice simply click on the View All Cards option and select one. All the information for that particular card is readily available on the website.

The major value of the AMEX Gold Charge Card lies in completing its monthly target.

AMEX has aRewards Multiplierportal just like HDFC Smartbuy from where you can purchase gift vouchers or do affiliate shopping and get 5X the usual reward points. Yes, 5X!!! This is simply too good to be true since MRCC offers only 2X onRewards Multiplier.

Redemption options on MRCC and Gold Charge are almost the same. You can also combine points on both of them for redemptions.

AMEX allows you to take a statement credit on eligible transactions or pay with points on select merchants while entering OTP for your transaction at a value of 25p/point. Most of the new AMEX cardholders use this redemption method but trust me there can’t be a method worst than this to use your MR Points. They are much more valuable than this so kindlyignorethese two options.

Another method to redeem your MR points. With this, you can purchase flights, prepaid hotels, car rentals, and more on AmexTravel. Again this gives you a value of 25p/MR point and is highlynot recommended.

AMEX further offers you a huge variety of instant vouchers against your MR points which have different values for different brands. In this section, there are certain brand vouchers like Amazon,TAJ, BigBasket, Croma, Flipkart etc. which give better value over others and are called Gold Collection vouchers from AMEX. To redeem the gold collection you need to redeem vouchers in multiple of 18,000 or 24,000 MR points.

Just for an idea, I have presented some values for the Gold Collection as Amazon andTajgive the highest and lowest monetary value per point. Also, keep in mind that AMEX vouchers can only be used to bookTajProperties at non-discounted rates. Amazon voucher option is good forcashback loverswhileTajorVistaravouchers are good for those who are into travelling.

Sometimes AMEX brings upHot Rewardson particular brand voucher redemption which may give a very tempting value. You just need to keep an eye on them.

Now, this is the hottest redemption option for MR points and if you can play well with this you can yield values of even greater than a rupee per point.

AMEX allows you to transfer points to 8 different airline partners and some of them are so unique that none of the Indian credit cards allows you to transfer points to them like Asia Miles. We have a curated list of all AMEX airline transfer partnershere. For booking award tickets using points, you can refer to thisposton the TechnoFino Community.

Now, this is the most sought redemption option since anyone with a Platinum or Gold status withMarriott Bonvoycan just extract a value of more than 1Re/MR point by transferring a 1:1 ratio with suite upgrades, breakfast and lounge access with complimentary drinks are an added plus. Since AMEX is the sole transfer partner to Marriott Bonvoy so many points miners use MR points only for transfer to Marriott. What remains to be seen is what value it will offer once Marriott Bonvoy goes full dynamic since January 2023.

Other than this you can transfer to Hilton Honors also but the value is not that great as compared to Marriott. We have curated a complete list of AMEX hotel transfer partnershere.

It takes about3-5 daysto transfer Amex MR Points to various loyalty programs so transfer them well in advance to use them.

Case 1:If you spend ₹1,000*6 (₹6,000) transactions per month then you get to earn 13440 MR points in a year and get a reward rate of 7.1% even if you redeem for Amazon Vouchers. But keep in mind that you need to pay annual fees of ₹4,500 in this case and reward rates decrease to 4.63%.

So anyway you get to earn a good reward rate of a minimum of 4.63% which is huge for an entry-level card.

Since AMEX charges zero fuel surcharge on HPCL pumps so you can fill fuel of 6K every month to complete your monthly milestone bonus points. On Gold Charge unlike MRCC, you get Regular MR points also on this.

Case 2:The real earning potential of AMEX lies in itsRewards Multiplierwhere you get 5X reward points on the Gold Charge and the reward rate increases by an insane 3%. You can buy Flipkart, Amazon Shopping etc. vouchers from here.

The only problem lies in the annual fees since there is no spend-based waiver on this card. But you have to follow the suggestions which I have shared above in the article to ensure that the reward rate doesn’t drop.

TechnoFino Tip:Always try to split your transactions in multiples of ₹1000 to reach your milestone faster.

Gold Charge is the inferior of the two charge cards AMEX offers in India but it offers quite a good of lifestyle offers which keep on changing. All the ongoing offers can be foundhere. Do explore them since some of them offer 100% cashback also!!

AMEX has recently started serving the followingTier 2/3 citiesas well

Agra, Ajmer, Allahabad, Ambala, Amritsar, Aurangabad, Chittoor, Dehradun, Goa, Guntur, Guwahati, Jodhpur, Kanpur, Kolhapur, Kozhikode, Kurnool, Madurai, Meerut, Patiala, Raipur, Rajkot, Ranchi, Thrissur, Trichy and Udaipur.

Application through referral is a clear-cut winner due to the extra 4000 bonus points. Since everything else is the same then why lose the extra 4000 MR points? Check out the link for detailed referral benefits information.

AMEX is one of those cards in which one redemption option can’t fit everyone. Some find solace in gold collection vouchers and others inMarriott Bonvoytransfer. Miles enthusiasts can extract value from airline transfers too. So there is something for every AMEX card holder. While redemption opportunities are a lot I wish AMEX would bring 3X and 5X offers from time to time just like in 2020 so that everyone can rack up some points fast!
