Term insurance plans are one of the most popular insurance products in India. They are also known as permanent term insurance or permanent life insurance. They provide coverage for a specific period of time. This is usually up to 10 years and can be renewed for additional periods of time.
Term Insurance is the type of life insurance in which if death occurs during the policy tenure, then his or her nominee will receive the sum assured. If the insured survives till the end of the policy period, then he or she will not get any maturity amount. These policies have low premiums and cover the large risk.

## **Factors To Consider Before Choosing a****Term Insurance Plan**
There are innumerable factors of the **best insurance term plan** that you should consider before choosing one, and here are a few.
### **1. Risk Coverage**
The primary advantage of an insurance policy is risk coverage. The insurance company provides monetary compensation to the family of the deceased insured to compensate against the premium paid by the insured.
This enables covering the risk of the family.
### **2. Varied Plans**
Insurance companies offer different plans to suit the need of the insured — higher premiums results in higher benefits.
### **3. Health Benefits**
Insurance policies cover expenses of hospitalization and treatment of critical illness.
### **4. Inculcates Savings Culture**
Few insurance policies come with a savings plan. This enables subscribers to accumulate wealth while inculcating a savings culture for the future.
### **5. Additional Income**
Few insurance policies provide guaranteed income. When any uncertain event happens, the insured or the nominee of the insurance policy is paid the sum assured at every frequency (typically monthly or quarterly).
### **6. Availing Loan**
The insurance company provides you with a choice of giving credit to the insured. However, this facility is available only on selected policies.
### **7. Tax Benefit**
Availing insurance policy enables an individual to get tax benefits under [section 80C](https://groww.in/p/tax/section-80c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
## **5****Best Term Insurance In India****: Overview**

  1. **Life Cover + Monthly Income**


A pure term plan pays a fixed amount to the family of the insured + a fixed sum every month.
Under this cover, 100% of the sum assured is paid in a lump sum. Thereafter, 0.4% of the sum assured is paid each month for 120 months. Thus, under this cover, the plan pays 148% of the sum assured.
  1. **Life Cover + Increasing Monthly Income**


It is a pure-term plan which pays a fixed amount to the family of the insured + a fixed sum every month payable for 10 years that keeps rising by 10% every year to account for the rising living cost.
Under this cover, 100% of the sum assured is paid in a lump sum. Thereafter, the rising monthly income is paid for the next 120 months.
The first monthly instalment is 0.4% of the sum assured, which then rises by 10% (simple rate of interest) every year. Thus, this variant pays a total of 169.6% of the Sum Assured.
## **Conclusion**
Life/Term insurance is an arrangement between the insurer and the insured where the insurer compensates for the loss of life of the insured. The sum assured by the insurer is paid to the nominee or the legal heirs of the insured as defined in the policy document.
This is typically used to mitigate the risk of an untimely death of a family member and is used to safeguard the interest of the family members. 
Term insurance plans are a great way to protect your financial future and make sure you're covered in the case of an unexpected illness or injury. Because they last so long, term insurance plans can be used for large expenses—like paying for college or buying a house—or for smaller ones, like replacing a car or replacing household items destroyed by a fire.
While selecting a term plan, a person should keep in mind the purpose for which he is taking the term plan. Also, he should evaluate all the benefits offered by different term plans and should accordingly decide the plan he intends to take.
