There are quite a few credit cards in India with international lounge access options, but a few specifically catch the eye due to good benefits and a wide range of lounges in their program. Here I have curated a list of the best Indian credit cards for international lounge access which either provide guest access or shared access to addon members and are suited to different needs and budgets, making it simple for frequent travellers to choose a card that makes international travel a breeze even when travelling in a group and delivers fantastic benefits commitments.

Guest access to airport lounges can be a valuable feature for travellers who often travel with companions. Guest access is typically for a single visit or a limited number of visits and is meant for occasional use when travelling with a companion. Guests are usually allowed to enter the lounge when accompanied by the primary cardholder. Many premium credit cards in India offer Priority Pass membership, which often includes a set number of complimentary guest visits. I have compiled a list of the same as follows.

There are certain cards in India which offer shared access within the complimentary quota of the primary cardholder to addon cardholders. Add-on cards (also known as supplementary cards) are additional credit cards issued to the primary cardholder’s family members, usually sharing the same credit limit. Add-on cardholders have their own card and can access the benefits independently of the primary cardholder, including lounge access if the benefit is extended to add-on cards. Here I have compiled a list of the cards offering this facility.

The above two cards have the most powerful priority passes since they give you access to select domestic departure and arrival lounges which you cannot access complimentary using any of the credit cards available in India.
