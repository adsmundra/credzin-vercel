They have also recently launched anIndusInd EazyDiner Credit Cardwhich offers 25% OFF up to ₹1000.Also, there areno minimum billing amount requirements, This offercan be used unlimited times in a month along with a complimentary premium alcoholic beverage for the whole table!

Mypersonal experience with EazyDinerhas been quite smooth as compared to its major competitor Dineout as I have never been refused a table or denied the listed perks whenever booked. I happened to land on this application after getting a voucher for the fee paid for getting my Indusind Iconia Amex card. I used it for a family buffet at a five-star hotel in Gurugram back in 2018.

The good thing is that manyin-house restaurants of five-star propertiesare included in their network too. This makes my life easier when I am residing in them. Their mobile application is also very smooth and swanky with a clean user interface.

I got my lastmembership by redeeming Flipkart Supercoinsand it came damn cheap. For people living in tier 1 cities and eating out regularly, this application is the way to dine out. During a recent visit to Delhi, I happened to visit the Soda Bottle Opener Wala outlet in DLF Mall of Noida and my experience with EazyDiner and PayEazy was seamless. I used myAxis Vistara InfiniteCredit card to bust my bill worth around ₹4000 and paid just ₹1750. I have shared all the details in thistweet.
