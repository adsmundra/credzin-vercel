The reward rates using these cards are ahit or misssince IndusInd Bank has put categories like rental payments. utility bill payments and Insurance out of the standard reward rates. Sometimes the wallet loads get counted in the categories mentioned and you donâ€™t get what you are aiming at.

Other than the above cards other cards worth exploring areIDFC Select,HDFC Millennia,andICICI Amazon Pay.

With such a diverse list of the best credit cards for digital wallet loads and limited avenues to do so, one thing is for sure, it doesnâ€™t make any sense to get a card primarily for this purpose. So if you already have a card from the above list then reap its benefits to the core. If you donâ€™t need a card for any specific purpose but only wallet spends then getting aStandard Chartered Smartmakes a lot of sense with such a low annual fee and easy to achieve spends based waiver.

Else if you are already planning to get a premium card likeBOB EternaorStandard Chartered Ultimatethen you can use them without any fuss even on rental payments and donâ€™t need to bother getting any card listed down that list.

Also since AMEX has an offline acceptance issue so it would be better to use them aggressively on wallet loads.
