As soon as the opening bell of the market rings, traders will be on the lookout for setups and trading opportunities. However, some strategies show up right in the morning movements, helping traders earn profit. The Gap & Go is one such strategy, using which traders can make the most of the momentum and volatility of the first few minutes of the trading day. In this blog, we will take a look at the Gap & Go strategy and how you can trade it successfully.
## **Gap & Go Strategy**
As the name suggests, the Gap & Go strategy relies on the gaps between the closing and opening prices of an asset. Traders can identify these gaps to leverage the momentum and volatility during the initial trading hours. In addition, factors such as volume and liquidity are also considered to raise the chances of making a winning trade.
Before we learn more about the strategy, let’s understand what a gap is.
A gap in the stock market occurs when the opening price of a security is at a gap from the previous day’s closing price. A gap-up occurs when the price of a security opens higher than the previous day’s closing price. Similarly, a gap down occurs when the opening price is lower than the previous day’s closing price.
Traders also need to pay attention to the volume of a security which is the number of shares traded in a particular period.
## **How to Trade the Gap & Go Strategy?**
Gap & Go is a straightforward and effective strategy that traders can deploy. Here’s how traders can trade it.
## **Identify the Gap**
The first step of the Gap & Go strategy is to identify potential gaps. A gap will occur if the price of the security opens significantly higher or lower than the previous day’s closing price.
## **Confirm the Gap**
The second step is often the most crucial step and involves confirming the gap. To confirm that the gap is suitable for the Gap & Go strategy, the trader should check how large the gap is and also track the volume. If the volume is above average, it indicates that the trend is likely to continue.
## **Entry and Exit**
As a part of any trading strategy, setting the entry and exit points is crucial. Traders should wait out the first few minutes to identify suitable entry and exit points. In the case of a gap up, the entry should be above the high of the first few minutes and the stop-loss should be placed below the low of the first few minutes. In the case of a gap-down, the entry should be below the low of the first few minutes and the stop-loss, above the high.
## **Closing the Trade**
After the trade has been executed, the trader should monitor the trade. If the trade is winning, the trader can trail the stop-loss and book profits if the trend stalls or reverses.
Let’s look at an example to better understand the Gap & Go strategy.
  * Stock ABC’s closing price was Rs 95.
  * After market hours, the company released a piece of positive news.
  * During pre-market, ABC’s opening price was Rs 100.
  * A trader identifies this gap-up since the opening price is significantly higher than the closing price.
  * The trader analyses the stock’s volume which is higher than the average volume, confirming the bullish momentum.
  * After the opening bell ABC opens at Rs 100. Within the first few minutes, the stock makes a high of Rs 101 and a low of Rs 99
  * The trader enters the trade once the stock crosses Rs 101. The stop-loss is placed at Rs 99.
  * The momentum continues before the stock price starts reversing.
  * The trader exits the trade either when his target is met or his trailing stop-loss is triggered.


## **Things to Keep in Mind While Trading the Gap & Go Strategy**
A trader should keep a few key points in mind before making use of the Gap & Go strategy.
## **Time Sensitive**
The Gap & Go strategy is effective in the initial moments after the opening of the market, making it a time-sensitive strategy. Using the considerations for this strategy to enter into a trade later in the trading session may result in a negative impact.
## **Heightened Volatility**
Since the Gap & Go strategy is executed when the market opens, it is important to keep in mind that the market tends to be highly volatile during that period. With many traders entering and exiting positions, it is likely that the price of a security will be highly volatile.
## **Impact of Volume**
The trading volume acts as a key factor in the effectiveness of the Gap & Go strategy. A trader should confirm that the trading volume is higher than the average volume, which indicates that the trend is likely to continue.
## **Risk Management**
Trading the Gap & Go strategy can be risky and calls for solid risk management. A trader should set the position size according to his risk appetite. In addition, a stop loss order should be placed in order to limit losses.
## **Additional Tools**
While trading the Gap & Go strategy, the trader should make use of additional tools such as technical indicators and price action. A trader can make use of a [relative strength index (RSI) indicator](https://groww.in/blog/relative-strength-index-rsi) to identify overbought and oversold zones. In addition, candlestick patterns and price action can be used to identify key support and resistance levels.
## **Conclusion**
The Gap & Go strategy allows traders to capitalise on the momentum created by gaps in the market. The strategy is time-sensitive and relies significantly on the correct identification of gaps. Although the strategy has the potential to deliver substantial returns, it is necessary to have strong risk management practices in place.
