## TechnoFino Recommends
Yes Bank Marquee is highly recommended since both the joining fees and the annual fees are well covered by the points being given against the fee. The USP of unlimited lounge access and an unbelievable reward rate for online and offline spending will disrupt the market for sure. Yes Bank should try to rope in some more transfer partners as well if it wants to make its reward points-based card portfolio successful.
A feature-wise comparable card to this can be the ICICI Bank Emeralde Private Metal which comes at a similar joining fee points but without any substantial joining benefits.

Im currently using Regalia LTF. Does it make sense to make Marquee card as my primary card instead of regalia? My expenses are mix of everything but majority in online spends. Also, in most cases im making direct payments both online and offline (instead of smartbuy or vouchers). Looking for some advice regarding this. Thanks.

Marquee will be much better than Regalia if you want to reap travel benefits from your card.

I have Yes first preferred card and I remember paying for Amazon Voucher in 70/30 ratio e.g. 1000 Rs voucher would require 2800 RPs (~700 Rs) plus 300 Rs with other payment mechanism. I don’t want to make this caveat bigger that what it is but I thought I would mention as it might be applicable for this card too.

“International Lounge -> Guest Visits: 8 Complimentary Lounge visits per quarter” Should not it be 2 per qtr, i.e., 8 per year?
