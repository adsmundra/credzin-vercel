HDFC Bank, the OG of the credit card industry, is back in its original avatar after the lifting of the RBI embargo and is now looking quite aggressive with its lineup topped with its aggressive onboarding stance to regain its lost market share. Recently they relaunched their Infinia credit card which is the dream credit card for every credit card enthusiast in India and literally gives infinite of everything be it rewards, luxury hotel stays, lounge and golf course access and all the rest.

HDFC Infinia Credit Card is offered with VISA Infinite/MasterCard World variants and is generally offered with a minimum of8 lakhsof credit limit.

Since the card is offered only to UHNIs and spending requirements can be much higher than that yet there is nothing to worry about when you have an Infinia in your pocket as it offers you a unique NPSL* (No Pre-set Spending Limit) feature, which means they may “temporarily” increase the limit if you inform the “Infinia Support Team” prior to the swipe. Even if you exceed your credit limit by chance then there won’t be overlimit charges up to a certain extent usually around 10% of the credit limit. This feature is unique to Infinia and is not applicable to any other HDFC credit card. As I said earlier it gives truly infinite possibilities!

You get 5 reward points for every ₹150 spent anywhere. This gives you an equivalent amount of ₹3.30 for every ₹100 spent, meaning you can easilysave ₹3,300 for every ₹1 Lakhyou spend on the Infinia card.

With the HDFC SmartBuy portal HDFC Infinia card holders can accelerate their reward rates up to 10X equivalent to 33.33% for flight and hotel bookings whereas for voucher purchases the reward rate is 5x which translates to 16.67%

You can redeem your Reward Points onSmartbuyor Net Banking and various redemption options are as follows

HDFC Infinia also has numerousAirMilespartners andHotel loyalty partnersas well and transfer ratios stand at 2:1 or 1:1. Out of these partners the hotel partners have lost their value since ALL Accor transfer ratio was devalued and from Airline partners Krisflyer, Lifemiles, FinnAir (Avios) and Flying Blue are still very exciting and some are also unique for Indian credit cards.

This card makes no sense if you wish to slash your bill by taking statement credit since value simply dwindles to 30p a point.

In short, this card is the pass to all lounges offering complimentary food, beverages, Wi-Fi and comfy sofas even if you are on a round-the-globe trip with your whole family.

If you are a golf lover then it offers:

This is a newly launched offer for the Infinia Metal Edition card is to book a stay for 3 nights and pay for two at participating ITC Hotels. As per the fine print :

Another new offer to sparkle up the metal is that if you book 1 then you get 1 complimentary weekend buffet at participating ITC Hotels.

Not a noteworthy benefit though as many credit and debit cards nowadays provide fuel surcharge waivers. Infinia could have packed a solid punch if they had rewarded fuel spending also so that there would not have been any need for a dedicated fuel card for Infinia holders. With Infinia you get :

1% fuel surcharge waiver at all fuel stations in India.Minimum transaction value – ₹400Maximum transaction value – ₹1,00,000Maximum surcharge waiver per statement cycle – ₹1000

Infinia and DCB Credit Cards have a faster and dedicated support line that really gets your work done or fetches you the specific information about anything you want. Like Golf Booking, Itinerary planning and reservation assistance, Private dining assistance, International gift delivery, Event planning and referrals, Airport VIP service (meet-and-greet) and much more.

However, the markup charges of 2%+GST are a bit on the higher side as compared to some better offerings available now in the market. We can get an additional benefit of 1% cashback if we activate theGlobal Value Programon this card which will take the reward points value to 2%.

Hence there is freedom from buying all those travel insurance that we buy before going on an international holiday and we also get a cash withdrawal limit of 40% of the total which can act as a backup in extreme emergency situations. Though there are no charges attached with withdrawal be aware that interest will kick in from the date of withdrawal.

Officially, HDFC Bank Infinia Credit Card is an Invite Only card but unofficially you can request it if you meet any of the following conditions

Shocked? Yes HDFC Bank is a bit strict in issuing Infinia Credit cards until it sees any value in the relationship with you.

Bottomline is that either you must be a very high networth individual so that the bank looks at you as a potential customer in the near future or you have already given the bank enough business to absorb the price of all the promised luxuries because ultimately you will be one paying indirectly for all the benefits and bank earns via profits made on interests, loans and policies sold to you.

As said before, this is the best super premium credit card in India. No matter what your needs are, this card has the potential to fulfil almost all of them. With unlimited free lounge access, exclusive deals on dining and hotel booking, and a fuel surcharge waiver, this HDFC Infinia credit card can easily justify the high annual fee. So if you believe in the concept of paid cards and have the eligibility criteria fulfilled then this card can be the gateway for you to enter the world ofINFINITE POSSIBILITIES.
