Designed to cater to the needs of avid travellers, the HSBC TravelOne Credit Card offers a host of exclusive benefits, making it an ideal choice for those who frequently explore new destinations.
Here’s a closer look at everything you need to know about the HSBC TravelOne Credit Card and how it can elevate your travel rewards and experiences.

## **Charges and Welcome Benefits**
Joining Fees| ₹4,999 + GST  
---|---  
Welcome Benefits| 3,000 Points on spending 1L in 90 Days  
Renewal Fees| ₹4,999 + GST  
Renewal Benefits| NIL  
Renewal Fee Waiver| Spend ₹8L or more in a year.  
The 3,000 reward points offered as a welcome benefit do not fully offset the joining fee unless redeemed for ALL Accor.
That said, HSBC is currently running an “introductory offer” where cardholders who download the HSBC mobile app and spend ₹10,000 within the first 30 days can receive:
  * ₹1,000 cashback
  * ₹3,000 Postcard voucher
  * A 3-month EazyDiner Prime membership


This is not a standard offering with this card but is being given to make the card more popular initially. Some cashback and a PostCard Hotel voucher are really in line with what a travel-focused card should offer.
## **Reward Points Accrual**
**Spends Area**| **Reward Rate**| **Maximum Capping per Calendar Month**  
---|---|---  
All spends| 2 Reward Points per ₹100 spent| NA  
Airlines, Travel Aggregators & Foreign Transactions| 4 Reward Points per ₹100 spent| 50K Points  
The following transactions are ineligible for rewards: utilities, insurance, jewellery, education, government payments, real estate, financial services, money transfers, e-wallets, and fuel purchases. The exclusion list is even lengthier than that of the Axis Bank but here there is a striking difference as compared to [Axis Atlas](https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-atlas-credit-card-review/) that you will earn 2X points even on OTA’s MMT, Yatra, Cleartrip and likes. It would have been better had there been a 2X multiplier on Hotels too.
### **Milestone Benefits**
  * Get 10,000 points for spending ₹12L in a year


This jacks up the reward rate by almost 0.8% which is very mediocre just like the regular reward rate (2% to 4%) on this card.
## **Reward Points Redemption**
HSBC Bank provides a 1:1 transfer ratio for most loyalty programs and has roped in a lot of new loyalty programs from Indians’ point of view.
**Hotel Loyalty Program**| **Ratio**  
---|---  
[IHG One Rewards](https://www.technofino.in/ihg-one-rewards-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/)| 1:1  
[ALL Accor](https://www.technofino.in/all-accor-the-ultimate-guide/)| 1:1  
[Marriott Bonvoy](https://www.technofino.in/marriott-bonvoy-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/)| 1:1  
Shangri- La| 5:1  
Wyndham Rewards| 1:1  
|   
**Frequent Flyer Program**| **Ratio**  
[Air India Maharaja Club](https://www.technofino.in/air-india-maharaja-club-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/)| 1:1  
InterMiles| 1:1  
airasia rewards| 1:3  
[Air Canada Aeroplan](https://www.technofino.in/category/loyalty-guides/airline-loyalty-guides/)| 1:1  
Air France-KLM Flying Blue| 1:1  
British Airways Executive Club| 1:1  
Etihad Guest| 1:1  
Eva Air Infinity MileageLands| 1:1  
Hainan Airlines Fortune Wings Club| 1:1  
JAL Mileage Bank| 1:1  
[Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer](https://www.technofino.in/singapore-airlines-krisflyer-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/)| 1:1  
Qantas Frequent Flyer| 1:1  
[Qatar Airways Privilege Club](https://www.technofino.in/qatar-airways-privilege-club-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/)| 1:1  
Thai Airways Royal Orchid Plus| 1:1  
Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles| 1:1  
[United MileagePlus](https://www.technofino.in/united-mileageplus-the-ultimate-guide-for-indians/)| 1:1  
Vietnam Airlines Lotusmiles| 1:1  
Currently, there is no capping on the reward points transfer which is great.
## **Features and Benefits**
###  Lounge Access
**Access Type**| **Access Via**| **Complimentary Limit**  
---|---|---  
International| Lounge Key| 4/Year  
Domestic| MasterCard| 6/Year  
HSBC Bank is not asking for any spending to access the lounge which is great for the fee but as compared to [Axis Atlas](https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-atlas-credit-card-review/) there are no lounge access for the accompanying guests in this card.
### Movies and Dining
Buy 1 Get 1 on movies up to ₹200 on the District App twice per month and flat 10% off up to ₹1,000 on food ordering or booking events each once per calendar month via Zomato/District App.
### Golf Benefits
Enjoy 4 complimentary rounds of golf and 12 complimentary lessons per calendar year (max 1 per calendar month). Plus, get 50% off your green fees for additional rounds.
### Purchase Protection Policy
A **Purchase Protection Policy** on a credit card is a type of insurance that protects cardholders against theft, accidental damage, or loss of eligible purchases made with the card. It provides financial reimbursement or repair coverage for items that are damaged or stolen within a specified period after the purchase using the same credit card. The coverage is up to 180 days and ₹2,50,000 per instance.
### Other Travel Benefits
  * Save 15% on domestic and international holiday Bookings at Yatra, EaseMyTrip, PayTM Travel and ClearTrip
  * Save up to 20% at select duty-free stores in India via the AdaniOne app or website (minimum order value ₹8,000; once per card per year; max savings ₹3,000)
  * Save 11% when booking your getaway at StayVista (max 2 bookings per card per year; max saving per booking ₹3,000).


## **Bottomline**
The **HSBC TravelOne Credit Card** offers a decent rewards structure but struggles to stand out in a highly competitive segment. Designed as a competitor to **[Axis Atlas](https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-atlas-credit-card-review/)** , it falls short due to **limited milestone rewards, higher forex markup, restrictive exclusions, and lack of strong welcome benefits**.
Currently, **[Axis Atlas](https://www.technofino.in/axis-bank-atlas-credit-card-review/)** and **[AMEX Platinum Travel](https://www.technofino.in/amex-platinum-travel-credit-card-review/)** provide superior value for high-spenders. However, if **Axis Atlas** is devalued in the future, **HSBC TravelOne** may gain relevance. Until then, it remains a **decent but unremarkable** option in the travel credit card market.
