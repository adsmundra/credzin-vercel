1% fuel surcharge waiver max up to ₹500 per month.

The card just like the other two in the series is poorly rewarding whether it’s the joining benefits, renewal benefits or the earning rate. The market is loaded with better cards like Axis Atlas which beats even the elite version hands down. The only USP is the spending-based complimentary domestic lounge access to select lounges accessible only via PP which are now exclusive to cards likeHDFC Infinia, HDFC Diners Club Black and AMEX Platinum after the devaluation of Priority Passes ofAxis MagnusandAxis Reserve.
